Here intellectuals refers to an occupational category, people whose occupations deal primarily
with ideas—writers, academics, and the like.

it is critical to try to understand the patterns of their behavior and the incentives and constraints affecting those
patterns.

Butthe ultimate test of a deconstructionist’s ideas is whether other deconstructionists find those ideas
interesting, original, persuasive, elegant, or ingenious. There is no external test.

The great problem—and the great social danger—with purely internal criteria
is that they can easily become sealed off from feedback from the external world
of reality and remain circular in their methods of validation. 

In short, constraints which apply to people in most other fields do not apply
even approximately equally to intellectuals.

Many public intellectuals have been justly
renowned within their respective fields but the point here is that many did not
stay within their respective fields.

Many major economic decisions are likewise crucially dependent on the
kinds of mundane knowledge that intellectuals might disdain to consider to be
knowledge in the sense in which they habitually use the word.

Why the transfer of decisions from those with personal experience and a
stake in the outcome to those with neither can be expected to lead to better
decisions is a question seldom asked, much less answered.

concentrate power is easier then concentrate knowledge.

It is common, for example, for the intelligentsia to deplore many methods of sorting and labeling
things and people, often saying in the case of people that “each person should be
judged as an individual.” The cost of the knowledge necessary to do that is
almost never considered. 

Virtually all adverse conclusions about any ethnic minority are likewise
dismissed as “prejudices,” “stereotypes” and the like by the intelligentsia.

Earl warren laughing at police chief in court when police said expanding criminal rights would undermine
law enforcement.  Yet here, as elsewhere, the first-hand observations and years of personal day-to-day experience—in this
case, by a retired police commissioner—were not merely dismissed but ridiculed
by people who relied instead on shared but unsubstantiated assumptions among
the elite. 

The intellectuals’ exaltation of “reason” often comes at the expense of
experience, allowing them to have sweeping confidence about things in which
they have little or no knowledge or experience.

*mundane knowledge held by general population

One-day-at-a-time-rationalism: risks restricting its analysis to the immediate implications of each
issue as it arises, missing wider implications of a decision that may have merit as
regards the issue immediately at hand, considered in isolation, but which can be
disastrous in terms of the ignored longer-term repercussions.

Ex: Hurricanes in Florida and wildfires in southern California are likewise
recurrent phenomena over the years but each individual natural catastrophe is
treated as an immediate and discrete crisis, bringing not only government rescue
efforts but also vast amounts of the taxpayers’ money to enable people who live
in these places to rebuild in the known path of these dangers.
