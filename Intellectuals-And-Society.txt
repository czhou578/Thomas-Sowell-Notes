Here intellectuals refers to an occupational category, people whose occupations deal primarily
with ideas—writers, academics, and the like.

Karl marx never administered a gulag, adam smith never ran a business

au courant - french word, aware of what's going on

it is critical to try to understand the patterns of their behavior and the incentives and constraints affecting those
patterns.

Butthe ultimate test of a deconstructionist’s ideas is whether other deconstructionists find those ideas
interesting, original, persuasive, elegant, or ingenious. There is no external test.

The great problem—and the great social danger—with purely internal criteria
is that they can easily become sealed off from feedback from the external world
of reality and remain circular in their methods of validation. 

In short, constraints which apply to people in most other fields do not apply
even approximately equally to intellectuals.

Many public intellectuals have been justly
renowned within their respective fields but the point here is that many did not
stay within their respective fields.

Many major economic decisions are likewise crucially dependent on the
kinds of mundane knowledge that intellectuals might disdain to consider to be
knowledge in the sense in which they habitually use the word.

Titanic had best seaman in the world, but knowledge of icebergs (basic) doomed them

Why the transfer of decisions from those with personal experience and a
stake in the outcome to those with neither can be expected to lead to better
decisions is a question seldom asked, much less answered.

concentrate power is easier then concentrate knowledge.

It is common, for example, for the intelligentsia to deplore many methods of sorting and labeling
things and people, often saying in the case of people that “each person should be
judged as an individual.” The cost of the knowledge necessary to do that is
almost never considered. 

Virtually all adverse conclusions about any ethnic minority are likewise
dismissed as “prejudices,” “stereotypes” and the like by the intelligentsia.

Earl warren laughing at police chief in court when police said expanding criminal rights would undermine
law enforcement.  Yet here, as elsewhere, the first-hand observations and years of personal day-to-day experience—in this
case, by a retired police commissioner—were not merely dismissed but ridiculed
by people who relied instead on shared but unsubstantiated assumptions among
the elite. 

The intellectuals’ exaltation of “reason” often comes at the expense of
experience, allowing them to have sweeping confidence about things in which
they have little or no knowledge or experience.

*mundane knowledge held by general population

One-day-at-a-time-rationalism: risks restricting its analysis to the immediate implications of each
issue as it arises, missing wider implications of a decision that may have merit as
regards the issue immediately at hand, considered in isolation, but which can be
disastrous in terms of the ignored longer-term repercussions.

Ex: Hurricanes in Florida and wildfires in southern California are likewise
recurrent phenomena over the years but each individual natural catastrophe is
treated as an immediate and discrete crisis, bringing not only government rescue
efforts but also vast amounts of the taxpayers’ money to enable people who live
in these places to rebuild in the known path of these dangers.

statistical categories vs flesh and blood human beings

income distribution: assumes wealth exists somehow
The fact that one person’s productivity may be a thousand times as valuable as
another’s does not mean that one person’s merit is a thousand times as great as
another’s.

But only by assuming that everything that has not been done could have been
done, disregarding costs and risks, can individuals or societies be blamed
because the real world does not match some vision of an ideal society. 

Nothing is easier than simply assuming that things were better
before,

Any number of companies that have been said to “control” a majority of their
market have not only lost that market share but have gone bankrupt within a few
years of their supposed dominance of the market.

By saying that businesses have “power”
because they have “control” of their markets, this verbal virtuosity opens the
way to saying that government needs to exercise its “countervailing power”

government power is in fact power, since individuals do not
have a free choice as to whether or not to obey government laws and regulations, vs people who
have never went to walmart, and walmart can't do anything about it

The presumably key question whether Rockefeller’s pursuit of a larger fortune actually made the consuming
public worse off was seldom even addressed

There is little empirical evidence to suggest that the many government
interventions during the 1930s helped the economy and much evidence to
suggest that they made matters worse.m A 2004 study by economists in a leading
scholarly journal concluded that government policies prolonged the Great
Depression by several years.

—but as an anointed elite, people with a mission to lead others
in one way or another toward better lives.
In this vision, oppression, poverty, injustice and
war are all products of existing institutions—problems whose solutions require
changing those institutions, which in turn requires changing the ideas behind
those institutions.

But to be for “social justice” and “saving the environment,” or
to be “anti-war” is more than just a set of hypotheses about empirical facts. This
vision puts you on a higher moral plane 

At one time, Jews were in fact over-represented among Fascist leaders in Italy. Only after
Mussolini became Hitler’s junior partner in the Axis alliance of the late 1930s
were Jews purged from Italy’s Fascist party
In short, official and explicit government racist ideology and practice distinguished the Nazis from
other Fascist movements.

Communists served national interests despite whatever internationalist rhetoric they used 

Conservatism, in its original sense, has no specific ideological content at all,
since everything depends on what one is trying to conserve. 

Languages involved in a decentralized manner over many generations.

Thus the popular 1930s American radio
personality Father Coughlin—who was, among other things, an anti-Semite—
has been verbally banished to “the right,” even though he advocated so many of
the policies that became part of the New Deal that many Congressional
Democrats at one time publicly praised him and some progressives urged
President Franklin D. Roosevelt to make him a Cabinet member.

These arbitrary changes in classifications not only allowed the left to
distance themselves from embarrassing individuals and groups, whose
underlying assumptions and conclusions bore many similarities to their own,
these classification changes also allowed the left to verbally transfer these
embarrassments to their ideological opponents

The education of the young has long been a battleground between adherents of the two visions of the
nature of human beings and the nature of knowledge and wisdom.

 Ambiguity is introduced by programs which confront students
