Fallacies are both plausible and logical, with something missing. Results in political support, bad results.
REALITY: In other words, evidence is too dangerous— politically, financially and psychologically— for some people to allow it to become a threat to their interests
In short, reducing the set of mutually acceptable terms tends to reduce the set of mutually acceptable results.

EXAMPLES: Rent control, gov policies that promote employee benefits.

## FALLACY OF COMPOSITION:
what is true of a part is true of the whole.
Whole neighborhoods have been demolished and "redeveloped" with upscale housing and shopping malls as a means of "revitalizing" the community. Often the federal government subsidizes this operation.
Rich people have to be transferred somewhere, as well as displaced people.

## CHESS-PIECE FALLACY:

Adam Smith: who "seems to imagine that he can arrange the different members of a great society with as much ease as
the hand arranges the different pieces upon a chess-board.

STRATEGY: If one policy doesn't work, then keep trying until one works; can cause people to change their behavior in ways that adversely affect the economy.
No reliable framework for expectations, then that impacts investor and business sentiments.

## OPEN-ENDED FALLACY:

Resources are unlimited, who would be against health, safety, open space?
No matter how much is done to promote health, more could be done. No matter how safe things have been made, they could be made safer. And no matter how much open space there is, there could be still more.
**Big Idea**: Resources have alternative uses that could be more productive.
Open ended demands encourage more gov. misallocation of resources.

URBAN FACTS AND FALLACIES:

The spreading out of urban communities in general has been made possible by reductions in transportation costs.

## OVERPOPULATION FALLACY:

Photographs of crowded slums in Third World countries may insinuate the conclusion that "overpopulation" is the cause of poverty, when in fact poverty is the reason for the crowding among people unable to afford the transportation costs of commuting or much urban living space, but who are yet unwilling to forego the benefits of urban living.

CONGESTION:

Fact: The annual costs in both wasted fuel and wasted time have been estimated at more than a thousand dollars per rush hour traveler in Washington, San Francisco, and more than $1,500 in Los Angeles
Stockholm and Singapore tried to charge people who drive different amounts. Traffic declined in numerous ways.

- showed that "free" roadways contribute to congestion, as most "free" things are used more extensively than when the costs of people's behavior are conveyed to them directly through prices.
- More roads wouldn't increase congestion.

## AFFORDABLE HOUSING FALLACY:

needs gov. intervention. Disproved time and time again.
Height restrictions are among the many building restrictions which can be imposed. Moreover, if a community cannot expand upward, then it must expand outward, leading to longer commutes to work.
Without restrictions: High profit margins, over and above the costs of construction and land, attract more builders who wish to share in these lucrative returns on investments in home building.
Affordable housing: this might be subsidized by taxpayers, or making it mandatory that private builders sell a certain percentage of their housing at prices "below market".
FACT: Moreover, where these prices represent losses to the builders, these losses are made up by raising the prices of their other housing even higher.

What held in check the ability of government officials to micro-manage housing markets were property rights.
Consequences of no property rights: rich people can fence off their communities.
Land-use restrictions protecting "this way of life" have a cost paid by others.

## Slums FALLACY:

Slums aren't all filled with criminals. Slums needed to be demolished since they are dirty.
It appeared on the national level as far back as the administration of Herbert Hoover and was developed further during the subsequent New Deal administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt.

# Appraisers:

Eminent Domain: gov supposed to pay proper money to people whose properties they seize.
Appraisers have conflict of interest: based on their appraisal, gov may have to pay more or less.
Gov wants to "redevelop" a given area means that the market value of properties in that area will fall

More fundamentally, however, what the government compensates for is the value of what they take, not the value of what the property owner has lost.

Logic: what's being built is more valuable then what's torn down, then should be possible to compensate losers for their losses and still
have left over.

People who exercise eminent domain have incentives to exercise their authority far beyond the point where is a benefit.
changing people's location does not change their behavior

## Urban Sprawl Fallacy:

The underlying basis for the criticisms rests on a
presumption of better aesthetic taste on the part of third party observers, as
compared to the taste of ground-level inhabitants.

FACT: The American government in fact pays farmers 50
billions of dollars to take farm land out of production, in order to try to keep
agricultural surpluses from being even larger and more costly than they are.

## FALLACY:

It is often assumed that suburbanization means an increased use of
automobiles and therefore an increased use of fuels, resulting in an increased
pollution of the air.

While some jobs can move out of the city with the people, some other jobs cannot. Firemen, policemen, etc.
and so must commute from whatever distance is required for them to find housing that they can afford.

## MALE AND FEMALE FALLACIES

Moreover, these differences have changed over time, so that a lessening of income disparities between
the sexes cannot be automatically attributed to a lessening of employer
discrimination.

Mom's have domestic responsibilities, so incomes tend to lag behind men.

When women representation in higher level occupations and in the postgraduate education
required for such occupations was higher than in the 1950s, median age of marriage was higher.

As the median age of marriage began to decline, the
representation of women in high-level occupations and among recipients of
postgraduate degrees also declined

Evidence: In 1950, 94 percent of men but only 33 percent of women were in the labor force. This gap of 61 percentage points
narrowed to 45 percentage points by 1970. At the end of the century, the
gap was only 12 percentage points, as 86 percent of men and 74 percent of
women were in the labor force.

However, even if we were to find zero economic differences between those women and men who were truly comparable, that
would not mean that women and men as a whole had the same income or
the same likelihood of being hired or promoted.

Families didn't want females working outside, since they could get in trouble, businesses thought otherwise.
Thus whole occupations could be off-limits to women simply because it was mostly men who worked in those occupations.

Where an occupation is unionized and withdrawal from the workforce
means a loss of seniority, reducing the prospects of being promoted for women.

**FACT**: It has been estimated that a physicist loses half the value of his or her knowledge in four years, while a professor of English would take more than a quarter of a century to lose half the value of the
knowledge with which he or she began that career.

A number of studies have shown that women are far less likely than men
to choose occupations that require very long hours.

In principle, family responsibilities can be divided equally between
husband and wife, father and mother. In practice, however, that has not
been the norm in most places and in most periods of history.

In short, there are economic incentives both for and against
discrimination, and the net balance of their effects is an empirical question.

Nor are single women and single men comparable, when "single" people
include people who have been married for years, and have then been
divorced.

There have been, and continue to be, more women than men who are part-time workers

In general, it makes a difference whether the male-female income gap is
compiled on an annual basis, a monthly basis or as per-hour earnings.

## GLASS CEILING FALLACY:

older women whose job qualifications have been most affected by the accumulated differences in job
experience from that of men of similar ages.

Moreover, the spread of cases like that, settled by employers not able to afford the cost of fighting through the courts for years, would be enough to convince many observers that sex discrimination was widespread

which measure the upper limit of the combined effect of employer discrimination plus whatever other factors have been overlooked
or not specified precisely.

many married women have chosen to allow their husbands' best job opportunities to determine where the couple will live,
In other words, the passage of time increased husbands' earnings more than
the wives' earnings, another indication suggesting wives' investments in their
husbands' earning capacity.

# ACADEMIC FACTS AND FALLACIES

The principle of faculty self-governance is therefore central to the
operation of an academic institution.

In reality, some professors at various colleges and universities have openly admitted to
selecting textbooks on the basis of bonuses paid to them by the publishers
of particular textbooks.

**Interesting**: The concentration of classes within a narrow band of hours also means
that the college must build and maintain more classrooms than if the classes
were spread out from early morning through the end of the day.

If a course on history of movies can be used to satisfy a social science requirement, then a student can graduate
from a prestigious school ignorant of history and its implications.

state universities supported by taxpayers often claim to need more money in order
to educate students, when in fact research remains as much of a faculty
priority.

Grade inflation: hurts students long term, but makes professor's lives easier. Not doing so will show in teacher
evals, hurting their careers.

professors are able to confine the ideological spectrum to those views consonant with their own,

For example, reading materials available on-line or on DVDs
can replace books and bound volumes of academic journals, but if the accrediting agency uses
number of books in a college to make rankings, thats a conflict of interest.

**Example**: Some law schools, for example, hire many practicing attorneys and judges
to teach part-time in their respective specialties such as estate law or antitrust law, having fewer full time professors.
The American Bar Association, however, has refused to accredit a
number of law schools run this way.

Ex. University of Colorado law school, with 92 percent of graduates.

Consequences: involved spending more than $40 million for a new
building, and this and other cost increases led to a rise in annual law school
tuition from $6,700 to $16,738 for Colorado residents

Untenured faculty members whose current work is perfecdy satisfactory will
often be let go— not have their contracts renewed— when time comes for
the "up or out" decision.

In short, the goal of a policy— in this case, greater job security— turns out to have little to do with the actual outcome
of that policy, which is less job security than most people of similar ages have
in other sectors of the economy.

Outstanding teachers often terminated, due to insufficient time dedicated to research.

## FALLACY:

Good college means better life

REFUTATION: Cannot determine with different varying samples.

## FALLACY:

Colleges definitely add value

REFUTATION: But people whose education stops before college cannot be assumed to be the same in orientation, values,
priorities, or ability as people who go on to college. Therefore income
differences between them cannot be automatically attributed to what was
taught in college.

**Big Question**: What is the definition of dropout?

Example: This means that the incomes of people who dropped out of high school and later received an academic
degree without bothering to go back and get a high school diploma are very
unlikely to be counted in statistics on the incomes of high school dropouts.

**Big Idea**: What this means is that anything colleges and universities choose to
spend money on is called a "cost" by them— and is then used to justify
raising tuition .

But academic institutions are protected by, among other things, accrediting
agencies which treat the existing levels of amenities and perquisites as costs
that newcomers must incur in order to get the accreditation needed to
attract both students and government money.

## FALLACY: their costs for educating a student are greater than the price they charge as tuition

REFUTATION: But, since teaching is one of the joint products of an academic institution, along with
research and other ancillary activities, the meaning of such a statement is
elusive.

Argument: colleges and universities lose money on every student, hard to explain why they focus so much
on recruitment.

when a college does not have enough of the students it admitted actually
enroll to fill up the dormitories, the empty rooms may not reduce the cost
of upkeep as much as the missing students' missing tuitions reduce the
college's revenues.

students may be attracted to some big-name institutions whose prestige is
generated by professors who are unlikely to teach them, especially in their
freshman year, and who in some cases are not likely to teach them unless and
until they reach graduate school

FACT: colleges and universities routinely engage in price
discrimination that would get a private business prosecuted under the antitrust laws.

**Cartel**: Thus if a particular student from a family with a particular income, bank
balance, home equity, etc., had applied to Harvard, Yale, and M.I.T., these
institutions would jointly decide to coordinate their "financial aid" discounts
in such a way that the student would be faced with the same net price to be
paid at all three places.

The fallacy that keeps this perpetual tuition escalation going is ignoring the fact that subsidizing
existing "costs" provides incentives for those "costs" to rise.

University lobbying for earmarks.

Even richly endowed universities like Harvard and Yale do
not finance most of their research from their own money but from money
received from government and other outside sources

It is significant that the relatively few academic institutions that are
run for profit, including the University of Phoenix, which has more students
than any non-profit university, do not have football teams or stadiums.

**CLAIM**: worker's incomes have not risen significantly: data exclude the value of job
benefits such as health insurance, retirement benefits and the like, which
have been a growing share of employee compensation over the years

Moreover, "workers" lump together both full-time and part-time
employees, part time make less then full time.

### CPI Facts

The inflationary bias of the consumer price index results from the fact
that it counts the prices of a given collection of goods over time, while those
goods are themselves changing over time.

Another inflationary bias to the consumer price index is that it counts
only those things that most people are likely to buy. Newer expensive products are not counted
until they fall in price for more to afford.

## FALLACY:

jobs being lost in the American economy— whether to foreign competition or to technological change—
are high-wage and the new jobs being created are low-wage jobs.

Definition of "rich" vs "poor"
Similarly, the poor are usually defined in terms of current income, rather
than in terms of how much wealth they have or have not accumulated

But statistics do not distinguish between people whose current
incomes are low and people who are genuinely poor in the sense that they
are an enduring class of people whose standards of living will remain low for
many years, or even for life.

## Fallacy: American middle class is declining

REFUTATION: In other words, the number of middle class people
declines when there is a fIXed definition of "middle class" in a country with
rising levels of income.

## FALLACY: Corporate executive pay means "greed"

REFUTATION: Given the billions of dollars at stake in corporate decisions, $59 million
a year can be a bargain for someone who can reduce mistakes by 10 percent
and thereby save the corporation $100 million.

Source of moral outrage: if it's based on overcompensation, what about inherited wealth??
Like most economic transactions, the hiring of a corporate
CEO is not a zero-sum transaction. It is intended to make both parties
better off.

Third party observers may find it galling that some people seem to be
rewarded handsomely for failing. But third parties are neither paying their
money nor are in a position to know how much it is worth to be rid of
someone.

When more than two-thirds of the economic resources available to people in the bottom 20 percent of income
earners get left out of income statistics because they are transfers in cash or
in kind from government, that is a serious discrepancy between statistics and
reality.

If the value of the services rendered exceeds the pay, then both
consumers and stockholders are better off, not worse off, whether the person
hired is a corporate CEO or a production line employee.

Analogy: Replace commercial airline pilot with a crop duster pilot at lower pay, would that make the
stockholders and passengers better off??

## RACIAL FACTS AND FALLACIES

Rising rates of intermarriage have reduced the biological significance of
racial differences, even as its political significance has increased.

Comparing groups to national average

WRONG: But either conclusion can be misleading when the national average itself is just an amalgamation
of wide variations among many ethnic, regional and other groups.

## Fallacy:

The passage of time reduces the hostility and
discrimination racial minorities face.

Years after emancipation, blacks born during the era of slavery remained reluctant to
tell white people their full names

While, in the late twentieth century, an absolute majority of those black
families with no husband present lived in poverty, more than four-fifths of
black husband-wife families did not.

In general, discrimination must take its place among the various other factors behind
intergroup economic differences.

Somewhat similar conclusions were implicit in W.E.B. DuBois'
nineteenth century study which concluded that if all white people lost their
racial prejudices overnight, it would not make much difference to most black
workers.

## THIRD WORLD FACTS AND FALLACIES

The preference of many Third World governments for foreign aid over
such alternatives as using international financial markets to raise money or
encouraging domestic entrepreneurs by relieving them of stifling red tape
and bureaucratic control is understandable. Letting private markets operate,
domestically and/or internationally, would mean relinquishing both power
and lucrative opportunities to reward political supporters and for political
leaders to take a cut of the money themselves.

In this joke, one friend says to another that statistics show that a man is hit by
a car in Manhattan once every 20 minutes. To which the other replies, "He
must get awfully tired of that."

Statistics are no better than the methods and definitions used in
collecting them. Without scrutinizing those methods and definitions, we
cannot assume that comparable people are being compared.

"Overpopulation," for example, can be defined in such a way that
a high ratio of people to wealth is said to explain poverty, when all that it
does in reality is demonstrate the rules of arithmetic, rather than any fact
about the real world.
