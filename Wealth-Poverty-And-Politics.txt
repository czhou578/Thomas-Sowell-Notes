Chinese more advanced then any european in terms of discovery and stem fields
Greeks located closer to middle east, agriculture spread quicker to greece.

Therefore explanations of economic differences cannot be confined to factors peculiar to a particular time or place

People or nations may be rich / poor because they produced more/less, or they took more/less from others
Spain was very rich due to its empire, but it spent all of it recklessly - one of the poorest countries in europe today

Real income: money income adjusted for inflation, consists of goods and services produced in the nation
Cannot look at it from standpoint of those receiving all the money for those goods

production vs transfer of wealth.

Geographic determinism: places with more natural resources supposed to be richer. Japan???
Geographical factors are different based on interactions.
Geography is not egalitarian

Interactions between different factors are important!

Cultural universe: knowledge that is transferred, but people get to see how others are doing things, can break
centuries old habits nurtured through isolation.

There have been vast deposits of petroleum in the Middle East from time immemorial. But it was only after science and technology had
advanced to a level that created industrial nations elsewhere that the
Middle East’s oil became a valuable asset.

Not only does rainfall vary greatly from one place to another, so does the
ability of the soil to hold the water that rains down on it.

Ancient greek agriculture vs ancient britain

defining environment as what is around a given people and defining environment to include also what is within those people.
QUOTE: "We do not live in the past, but the past in us."

African coastline is shorter then european coastline

CHARACTERISTIC: In terms of the contours of the land, sub-Saharan Africa has been characterized
as “cursed with a mesa form which converts nearly every river into a
plunging torrent on its approach to the sea.”

CHARACTERISTIC: rainfall patterns in sub-Saharan Africa include long periods when there is no
rain at all, followed by torrential downpours during rainy seasons

Continuous miles of navigable rivers. 
Ex: Sometimes a canoe can go ashore and be emptied of its cargo before reaching a waterfall, with both the canoe and the
cargo then being carried around the waterfall, so that the reloaded canoe can proceed on another level stretch of water.

CHARACTERISTIC: A broad coastal plain, where the land nowhere reaches 1,000
feet above sea level, means that Western Europe has had slow-flowing
rivers, which were especially valuable

CHARACTERISTIC: Because the warming effect of the Gulf Stream on the climate of Western
Europe is lessened the farther east one goes, the waterways of Eastern
Europe are frozen more often, and longer, in the winters.

CHARACTERISTIC: Even when the rivers of Eastern Europe are flowing, often they are
flowing into lakes or inland seas, rather than out into the open seas that
connect with the rest of the world.

CHARACTERISTIC: Mississippi river has more water then Nile, and drops less inches per mile.

-----------> FISHING

Fishing villages represent a step upward from a hunter-gathering
society to a sedentary life. Fishing opportunities vary depending on land.

---------LAND AND CLIMATE----------

About 10 to 12 percent of the world’s population lives in mountains, about half in Asia
Mountain people suffer from poverty and backwardness. Mountain valleys are often isolated, 
Fertile soil are washed down.

technology cannot undo centuries of cultural isolation. Substandard infrastructure remains common in
mountains around the world, even in the twenty-first century

language moved slowly up from lowlands to highlands.
Law and order are harder to establish; common for highland people to raid and plunder the more prosperous people in lowlands.
People live shorter lives.
Children have to work at early age, preventing an education.
People from lowlands have disdain toward highland people due to cultural differences

Longer lasting migrations have included many mountain men who became mercenaries in various armies
Although mountains form rivers.

---------->soil
agriculture originated in Iraq. Tigris and Euphrates rivers washed nutrients over land.
In Asia, agriculture began on the Indian subcontinent, in the valley of the Indus river, in what is today Pakistan.

Moreover, the dryness of much of Africa inhibits the use of fertilizers to supply the nutrients missing in the
soil. Fertilizers used without adequate water can inhibit, rather than enhance, the growth of crops.

Wetlands in Africa contain tropical diseases. 

FACT: Even though the heat of sunlight is greatest in the tropics, nevertheless the sun shines more hours per day during the summer in
the temperate zones than in the tropics, allowing a longer daily buildup of heat.

Clouds interact with latitude, since clouds reflect sunlight. 

-------->Living in temperate vs tropics

This meant that peoples living where seasons changed drastically
had to develop a sense of urgency about time, and the discipline to
adjust to its requirements.

This required not only the discipline of saving, but also the conversion of
perishable foods like milk and fruit into storable foods like cheese and
jam.

--------->Animals

What was totally lacking throughout the Western Hemisphere when the Europeans arrived were
horses, oxen and other heavy-duty draft animals or heavy-duty beasts of
burden.

Wheels? The issue is not the intellectual capacity to invent the
wheel but the economic value of wheels in absense of animals.

Without beasts of burden, less cargo can be collected and dispersed inland, making ships less big as a result.

CHARACTERISTIC: Another of the cultural factors fragmenting the peoples in tropical
Africa is a multiplicity of languages, out of all proportion to the size
of the population.
