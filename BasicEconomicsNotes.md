## **DEFINITION**: economics is the study of use of scarce resources which have alternative use

It is also, and more fundamentally, about producing that output from scarce resources in the first place—turning
inputs into output.

alternative uses: water can be used to produce ice or steam by itself or innumerable mixtures and compounds in combination with other things.

inefficiently turning input to output makes lagging economies. Russia is an example.

- volume of goods and services that determine whether society is prosperous

LESSON: Look at **incentives** they create, not simply the goals to pursue

prices do the job of conveying market info, and not appointed gov. bureaucrats, But it is not the prices that cause the scarcity.
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in her memoirs said that Mikhail Gorbachev “had little understanding of economics,”

**Fact**: government declared that something scarce was a basic right, that doesn't change the fact that its still scarce
cause natural resources to move from place to place: Japanese are willing to pay higher prices for natural resources, so the supply chain moves there

Soviet Union planned economy: where a chronic problem was a piling up of unsold goods in warehouses at the very time when there were
painful shortages of other things that could have been produced with the same resources. Central planning is too complicated for humans

Soviet enterprises always ordered more from gov. then needed, thus allocation of resources was very poor and inefficient.

"Greed" - may reflect changed market circumstances

**LESSON**: the price which one producer is willing to pay for any given ingredient becomes the price that
other producers are forced to pay for that same ingredient.

**LESSON**: resources tend to flow to their most valued uses when there is price competition in the marketplace

Reality: From the standpoint of society as a whole, the “cost” of anything is the value that it has in alternative uses.
Capitalist system forces mistakes to be corrected while socialist systems don't

Marx and Engels were both critical of government directly controlling economy

LESSON: the quantity supplied varies directly with the price

"Running out of ...." confuses economically available current supply with ultimate physical supply in the earth

LESSON: larger quantity is supplied at higher prices than at lower prices

**CLAIM**: Corporates are paid more then they are "really worth".

Prices going up/down can mislead people into thinking its deviating from "real" worth.

Objective vs subjective price: If paper's real value was 5 dollars, then if i offer $5 to the seller, then i wouldn't be gaining anything from the transaction, which makes it pointless. Also, one side would be getting worse on the deal, so they wouldn't want to do this....

"greed" or higher prices may mean more efficiency

**CLAIM**: We have unmet needs in our society

LESSON: there will always be unwanted needs based on definition above. Merely demonstrating an unmet need is not sufficient to say
that it should be met— not when resources are scarce and have alternative uses.

Robbing peter to pay paul, then robbing paul to pay someone else, infinite loop

should be seen as tradeoffs, not unwanted needs

## PRICE CONTROLS

LESSON: price changes are based on EXISTING PRICES

rent controls lead to apartments with 1 person living inside, decline in building permits, housing quality declines,
buildings abandoned since it is unprofitable when combined witih utility costs, less rent costs for wealthy, etc nyc

SCARCITY VS SHORTAGE - can have scarcity without shortage and vice versa

severe housing shortage in US after ww2 even though ratio of housing to people were the same.
sf earthquake in 1906,

**Big Idea** Rising prices not only allocate existing housing, they provide incentives for rebuilding and for renters to use less space in the meantime, as well as incentives for those with space in their homes to take in roomers while rents are high.

### HOARDING:

price controls allow lower priority uses to preempt higher priority uses, increasing the severity of the shortages,
whether of apartments or of gasoline.

### QUALITY GOES DOWN

quality will go down since there is such strong demand at a low price (will sell anyway)
patients spend less time with physicians in gov. run healthcare systems, also, patients go more frequently, delaying invasive procedures

price set above the free market level tends to cause more to be supplied than demanded, creating a surplus.
In great depression, gov bought a lot but it all was wasted while people were starving

sugar price support programs have big bipartisan support in congress (interest groups), gov subsidize production made things expensive
most agricul.subsidies go to big corporate farms, not family ones

**WTF**: subsidize farmers buy forcing prices up, then subsidize customers by bringing prices down again

The greater the difference between free market prices and the prices decreed by price control laws, the more severe the consequences of price
control.

However, if the prices of flashlights skyrocket, a family that might otherwise buy multiple flashlights for its members is more likely to make do with just one of the unusually expensive flashlights—which means that there will be more flashlights left for others.

Someone once pointed out that Newton was not the first man who saw
an apple fall. His fame was based on his being the first to understand its
implications.

alternative ways to ration: It might be possible for sellers to ration how much they will sell
to one buyer. But this puts the seller in the unenviable role of offending some
of his customers by refusing to let them buy as much as they want

## SYSTEMIC CAUSATION

Economics is concerned with what emerges, not what anyone intended

- there is a tendency toward intentional explanations of systemic events in the economy, when people are
  unaware of basic economic principles

It often costs more to deliver goods and services in low-income neighborhoods, why things in the hood are expensive
prices ration scarcity, not create that scarcity

Failure to supply goods, as a result of government restrictions, must be sharply distinguished from an inability to produce them.

However, competing indirectly by having to keep your demands within the limits of your own pocketbook is very different from
seeing your desires for government benefits thwarted directly by the rival claims of some other group.

> What price controls, subsidies, or other substitutes for price allocation do is reduce the incentives for self-rationing. People become excessive in their use.

---

## INSTRUMENTAL SUBSTITUTION

Health is more important then music, but 20 year supply of band aids is not worth more then giving up music entirely
LAW: categorical priority, declaring one thing absolutely important over other and setting policies

> A diamond may be worth much more than a penny, but enough pennies will be worth more than any diamond.

That is why incremental trade-offs tend to produce better results than categorical priorities

regulations: cost exceed benefits??

## SUBSIDIES AND TAXES

> subsidize “good” things and tax “bad” things.

taxes and subsidies misstate the relative scarcities of things and the relative values that
the users of these things put on them.

> TAKEAWAY: Making anything artificially cheap usually means that it will be wasted, whatever that thing might be and wherever it might be located.

## MEANING OF COSTS

removing things from cost-benefit analysis is question like: How can you put a price on art?

prices are not put on things. If it takes time & resources to develop, then it would cost something!!!

Ultimately, to society as a whole, costs are the other things that could have been produced with the same resources.

For example, politicians who say that they will “bring down the cost of medical care” means
reducing the price of medicines and reducing the fees charged by doctors or hospitals.

> But the cost of medical care (training doctors, making new medicines) will not go down.

What all these schemes have in common is that they exempt some things from the process of weighing costs
and benefits against one another

> LESSON: people don't need to know all the in depth details of products when picking and choosing because those differences are reflected in the price itself.

In a central planned economy, good allocation will require a lot of knowledge about particular wants and needs in different areas

## RISE & FALL OF BUSINESSES

### Fall of A&P grocery stores.

Huge supermarkets in shopping malls with vast parking lots decisive advantages
over neighborhood stores—such as those of A & P. People bought more with less trips, thanks to cars and freezers.

high volume means that delivery costs from producers is lower, since they only need to do so to one place.
faster lines at checkout

consequences of losses are bad for business, but good for overall economy and consumers

An economy based on prices, profits, and losses gives decisive advantages to those with greater
knowledge and insight.

> LESSON: in central planned economy, new insights by a citizen is is ignored because they don't have the power to innovate, so bad policies continue.

competitors carry conventional strategies into hot markets, which fails often

LESSON: Rising stock prices mean what matters is that such a rise in stock prices usually means that either the
business is now serving more customers, or offering them better quality or lower prices, or is operating at
lower cost

QUESTION: With profits eliminated, prices should have been lower in socialist countries, according to theory,
and the standard of living of the masses correspondingly higher. Why then was it not that way in practice?

socialism's inefficiency would not exist in capitalism, (bankruptcies and losses).

> Put differently, profit is a price paid for efficiency.

If in fact the cost of profits exceeded the value of the efficiency they promote, then non-profit
organizations or government agencies could get the same work done cheaper or better than profit-making enterprises.

The only person whose payment is contingent on how well the business is doing is the owner of that business.

profits on sale vs profit on investment are different.

investment profits are important not only to investors but the economy, as it determines rate of profits over entire sectors,
so the money is appropriately flowing into the proper areas.

> EXAMPLE: bread is sold quicker then pianos, so pianos have higher markup if owners want a good annual return.

cut profits on items sold, more can be used for investment, growing the business, not a zero sum game
ex: supermarkets (volume of sales)

## ECONOMIES OF SCALE

No such thing as "the cost", its different for production volume
Large fixed costs are among the reasons for lower costs of production per unit of output as the amount of output increases.

Lower costs as volume increases: scaling
scaling can help reduce costs despite advertising

there is a point where cost of production / unit doesn't decline as production increases
“A.T. & T. is so big that, if you gave it a kick in the behind today, it would be two years before the head said ‘ouch.’”

> if a company is too big, then it can be hard to manage, and bureaucracy will prevent quick responses to the market

smaller and specialized hospitals are safer for patients then large hospitals

soviet farms were 10x american farms, but very inefficient

## CAPACITY

- cost varies according to existing capacity
- capacity needs to be able to handle peak volume, so excess capacity is possible

- cruise ship example: 2x # of passeng. during peak season may require extra ship, but 2x # of passeng. during offseason doesn't.
  this means discounts are given in offseason.

## PASSING DOWN COSTS

passing down costs is not automatic and depends on competition faced by business, and how many of the competing companies have the
same cost increases or decreases.

> If you ship your product to market by railroad and the railroads raise their freight charges, you can pass that on to the
> buyers only to the extent that your competitors also ship their product by rail. If competitors using trucks, then they can simply
> take your customers away.

VOCAB: remunerative

## SOCIALIST ECONOMIES

- Socialist economies also lack the kinds of financial incentives that lead each given producer in a capitalist economy to
  limit its work to those stages of production and distribution at which it has lower costs than alternative enterprises.

soviet economy: self sufficient, even though others could make this for cheaper (gov. deadlines over efficiency)
soviet inventories always overflowing, doesn't benefit public and adds costs.
transportation / reliable suppliers allows for small inventory, since connection to customer is reliable and trustworthy

## BIG BUSINESS

- Characteristics of big business: economies of scale and diseconomies of scale,
- they typically take the form of a corporation, rather than being owned by a given
  individual, family, or partnership.

Harvard Corporation was US's first corporation

A corporation, however, has a separate legal identity, so that the individual owners of the corporation are not personally
liable for its financial obligations

limited liability: millions of shareholders control company through stocks.

LESSON: The “Ltd.” or “Inc.” after a corporation’s name warns creditors in advance, so that they can
limit their lending accordingly and charge interest rates adjusted to the risk.

**Claim**: corporation separates ownership and management, point for criticism.
REFUTATION: people may not want to manage despite owning a share of company.

**CLAIM**: corporations are undemocratic
REFUTATION: stockholders and even consumeres may not want that.

## EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

CLAIM: Corporate executives are paid too much

REFUTATION: comparing the pay of CEOs of public corporations, owned by many stockholders, with the pay of CEOs of
corporations owned by a small number of large financial institutions.

Financiers who have their own money at stake pay CEO's more.

> Golden parachute: cost more later for a bad ceo, so should just pay the money and let bad ceo go

## MONOPOLIES AND CARTELS

Most big businesses are not monopolies and not all monopolies are big business.

- consumers of a monopolist’s product are foregoing the use of
  scarce resources which would have a higher value to them than in alternative
  uses.

monopolist “restricts output”, not the intent or the monopolist doing so
monopoly's higher price - less purchases - less production

cartels need a way to enforce internal compliance.
smaller businesses fight cartels by offering at lower prices, so cartels who charge for higher profits are at risk

## ANTI TRUST LAWS

Ideally, a regulatory commission would set prices where they would have been if there were a competitive marketplace.

- average costs imposed by regulators are irrelevant when avg costs suddenly become high or low
- civil aeronautics board kept out competitor airlines, so air fares were high.

## COMPETITION VS COMPETITORS

LESSON: what is detrimental to competition and what is detrimental to competitors.

free competition is replaced by gov. intervention to force companies to facilitate competitors, it seems like it protects competitors

CLAIM: standard practice in US courts: is to describe the percentage of sales made by a given company as the
share of the market which it “controls.”

if one material is controlled by monopoly and is expensive, then it makes substitutes more attractive

outside importers of same product doesn't mean that monopoly exists even if only one company in a country makes same products

> LESSON: In economic terms: when higher prices for A cause people to buy more of B, then A and B are
> substitutes, whether or not they look alike or operate alike.

> A company which cannot keep competitors out is not a monopoly, no matter what percentage of the market it may have at a given
> moment.

us law prohibits collusion to fix prices

BUSINESSES VS NON MARKET PRODUCERS

competing enterprises have been largely confined to market economies

**Fact**: Government agencies are monopolies, and are very often less efficient compared to private companies

**Fact**: Winner and losers shouldn't be confused with imbalances

EXAMPLE: London’s The Economist magazine likewise pointed out that in India one can “watch the tellers in a state-owned bank chat amongst
themselves while the line of customers stretches on to the street.”

> Behind all of this is the basic fact that a business is selling not only a physical product, but also the reputation which surrounds that > product.

LESSON: The fact that scarce resources have alternative uses implies that some enterprises must lose their
ability to use those resources, in order that others can gain the ability to use them.

farm and farm worker declines led to greater # of industry workers.

> LESSON: To know what the new discoveries were going to be would be to make the discoveries before the discoveries were made. It is a
> contradiction in terms.

LESSON: Neither enterprises nor individuals can spend all their current income, as if there are no
unforeseeable contingencies to prepare for.

## PRODUCTIVITY AND PAY

engineer who added 250k in earnings to company is worth 200k salary
EXAMPLE: In short, lower productivity in British-owned companies reflected differences in management practices, even when
productivity was measured in terms of output per unit of labor.

businesses in 3rd world countries may have to absorb higher transport costs. At same price, net revenue would be less, making the value of
labor worth less

differences in age. Three-quarters of those American workers who were in the bottom 20 percent in income in
1975 were also in the top 40 percent at some point over the next 16 years.

LESSON: born, live, die in poverty/rich, very different from not yet reaching income level of older, more experienced people.

wealth and income are different things

FALLACY: Yet it is all too common to read journalists and others discussing how “society” distributes its income, rather than saying in plain
English that some people make more money than others.

LESSON: If we count as genuinely poor that 5 percent of the population which remains in the bottom 20 percent over a period of years,
then the genuinely rich and the genuinely poor—put together—add up to less than 10 percent of the American population.

LESSON: Focus on real income per capita.

CLAIM: the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer when comparing income based on top and bottom brackets

LESSON: In other words, the incomes of people who were initially at the bottom rose more than the incomes of people who were initially at the top.

This may help explain such anomalies as hundreds of thousands of people with incomes below $20,000 a year who are living in homes costing $300,000 and
up.

Assumption that income brackets denote "class". If that was true, then trends of brackets === trends of individuals, which is not the case.

workers judged by ability to apply mental proficiency to tasks

refused to pay women workers, but did so for unproductive males, risked losing it all

subsidized things don't count in income statistics, people on welfare would make income inequality greater

LESSON: women raising children, loses years of experience and time, lower incomes
LESSON: women also choose different jobs (librarian vs engineer)

LESSON: Empirical evidence strongly indicates that racial discrimination tends to be greater when the
costs are lower and lower when the costs are greater.

FACT: The “Rosie the Riveter” image that came out of World War II was in part a result of wage and price controls.

-------------------CAPITAL, LABOR AND EFFICIENCY-----------------------

LESSON: Capital complements labor in the production process, but it also competes with labor for employment.

bus drivers not unionized, then companies can hire more of them at lower wage rates, more frequent buses, less waiting time

LESSON: efficiency cannot be defined without mentioning human preferences and desires

Alternative uses of time may not be as productive

infinite repairs vs just getting it replaced.

----------------MINIMUM WAGE LAWS---------------------------------------

Higher costs in the form of mandated benefits have the same economic effect as higher costs in
the form of minimum wage laws.

the higher min. wage goes, more experienced union members can displace less experi. union members, thats why unions want min wage.

FALLACY: min wage to provide a living wage.
EVIDENCE: But 42 percent of minimum-wage workers live with parents or some other relative. In other
words, they are not supporting a family but often a family is supporting them.

Using such research methods, you could survey people who have played Russian roulette and “prove” from their experiences that it is
a harmless activity, since those for whom it was not harmless are unlikely to be around to be
surveyed. Thus you would have “refuted” the “myth” that Russian roulette is
dangerous.

south african laws put wages at high levels since they didn't want to become west's sweatshop. Thus, companies moved operations
out and more people become jobless.

Unemployability, like shortages and surpluses, is not independent of price.

LESSON: “Because they have no alternative” may be one answer. But that answer implies that low-wage employers provide a better option than these
particular workers have otherwise—and so are not making them worse off.

--------------------SPECIAL PROBLEMS IN LABOR MARKETS------------------------

compare what percentage of the adult population outside of institutions (colleges, the military, hospitals, prisons,
etc.) are working.

The point here is that, while people who choose not to look for work are not employed, they are also not automatically classified as unemployed.

frictional unemployment: college grads who don't have jobs to graduate into.

cars caused unemployment for people in horse industry, but the car industry needed a lot of employees too, common fallacy (net job loss)

Growth in per capita output permits both higher pay and better working conditions, while competition for workers forces individual
employers to make improvements in both,

labor unions don't want kids in workforce because it would make competition, teachers want kids in school longer so schools can be funded

shorter work weeks at same rate/hr makes hiring more expensive, reducing employment

third world countries with worse employment conditions, people still want the jobs

multinational corporations competition has driven up wages even in native businesses

LESSON: unions set wages to $20, then company has to pay for additional capital to raise productivity above $20
LESSON: unions make businesses less competitive, look at US car industry

FACT: teachers and gov unions are by far the biggest unions

----------------EXPLOTATION---------------------

LESSON: government firms have restricted the entering of new competitors into an industry
LESSON: higher earnings in non competitive industries doesn't mean its higher then in competiti. industries

FALLACY: wealth created vs individual paid is exploitation
REFUATION: Babe Ruth would be the most exploited of all time. He carried Yankees franchise

In some situations, people in a given occupation may be paid less currently than the rate of pay necessary to continue to attract a sufficient
supply of qualified people to that occupation.

company who builds a big dam in a river can be exploited by local gov. requiring it to pay higher wages or higher taxes.

REAL PROBLEM OF POVERTY IS NOT PRODUCING ENOUGH

---------------JOB SECURITY-----------------

LESSON: Countries with job security laws typically have higher unemployment.

Average american has 9 jobs between ages 18 to 34.

Job security laws reduce efficiency and flexibility

------------OCCUPATIONAL LICENSING---------------

LESSON: although rationale for requiring licenses was to root out unqualified people, the public has rarely demanded it
common for licesing to exempt alread existing businesses / conflict of interest

-------------------INVESTMENT-----------------

- specializing in a useless field, the lower pay means a waste of scarce resources
- life experience sometimes is better then classroom education

LESSON: 3rd world country, more people get useless degrees, gov has to hire them to prevent political unrest, increases red tape,
makes it harder for qualified people to create & progress

big sums of money owned by institutions are a reflection of small sums of many individuals

LESSON: lack of financial institutions to allocate capital in poor countries restrict entrepreneurial ability

LESSON: payday loans; short term loans to low income people. They are not 1 year loans

FALLACY: annual rate of interest on these loans are astronomical
REFULATION: those loans aren't given out for a whole year! ex. Salmon costs 10k a year (not going to be buying salmon everyday)....

interest- cost includes the risk involved in sending out the loan.

SPECULATORS: farmer doesn't want to guess what price to sell his wheat, so he sells it to a speculator who pays him in advance regardless
of what market price is, frees up farmer for doing his work.

----------------INVENTORY AND PRESENT VALUE--------------------
LESSON: inventory is a substitute for knowledge

A soldier won't know the # of bullets he will fire in battle, so he carries more, but too much, will slow him down

DEFINITION: The “present value” of an asset is in fact nothing more than its anticipated future benefits, added up and discounted for the
fact that they are delayed.

present value of asset reflects future benefits/detriments immediately.

An insurance company not only has the advantage of large numbers, it has the further advantage that its
existence is not limited to the human lifespan.

Reduce risk comes from greater predictability of large numbers

oil's present value is based on how much can be drilled so that it can repay the costs of drilling

FALLACY: We are running out of oil (1970s)
REFUTATION: No! Drilling fell due to supply and demand, no correlation with actual oil supplies
FACT: 2/3rd of oil in oil pools are left there, since extracting isn't worth it

FACTS: US has 1000 years worth of ntrl gas, study was repudiated to reach more politically correct results

------------------STOCKS, BONDS AND INSURANCE-----------------

money has different values based on time of it received (inflation included)

Bond increases value due to interest rate, what about capital gains?? That sum of money is equivalent to each other
Capital gains: if inflation had reduced value of the bond upon maturity?
if inflation had wiped out the profits of buying that bond?

Bonds have to be paid, legally (kind of like employees)

LESSON: venture capitalist needs >= 50% return on successful ventures to cover for losses

LESSON: fast growing company: stocks may be better, stable company, bonds..

FACT: In past, shipowners liked owning 10% of 10 different ships, then one whole ship; greater chance of losing, but less chance of very bad loss

For similar reasons, Hollywood agents have acquired percentage shares in the future earnings of unknown young actors and actresses who looked
promising, thus making it worthwhile to invest time and money in the development and marketing of their talent.

-----------------INSURANCE------------------
As with other forms of insurance, risks are not simply transferred from one party to another, but reduced in the process.

a lot of customers, more data on insurance risks, so risks are less.

FACT: About two thirds of life insurance companies’ income comes from the premiums paid by their policy-holders and about one-fourth from earnings on their
investments

LESSON: Moral Hazard - with insurance, more damanges can be tolerated by buyers, how to determine premium?

LESSON: Adverse Selection - incidence of disease X doesn't factor in likelihood of happening under certain situations

MISTAKE: force banks to all have deposit insurance, people didn't care about whether companie's policies were reckless, lost the
incentive to leave, thus savings and loan associations lost a lot of money

Insurance is about risk, not fault, forcing everyone to have same insurance charge would raise overall price.
FEMA encourages risk taking, paid for by taxpayers

------------PROBLEMS OF TIME AND RISK------------------

LESSON: not all rewards are paid in time when they are finished (shoe shining vs oil)
RISK VS UNCERTAINTY
circulation of $ decline, slows economy

LESSON: In general, wherever A pays a low cost to impose high costs on B through delay, then A can either extort money from B or
thwart B’s activities that A does not like, or some combination of the two.

EXAMPLE: environm. report, little cost but imposes big delays that can ruin a project
LESSON: Time is money, against political risk

WHAT A QUOTE: "what things cost in the past is history, what the supply and demand today is economics"

"Present value", anticipates the future; company can get punished by stock price if shareholders anticipate ....

Time and foresight can impose consequences of policies unforeseen, politicians only care about next election

----------------NATIONAL OUTPUT--------------------

fallacy of composition: what applies to small, doesn't mean big.

LESSON: Interaction between individuals is ignored. Gov can always bail out industries, but at what cost to other industries??

FALLACY: too much economic output leads to scaling back production, loss of jobs
REFUTATION: so much richer and produce more now, where is the catastrophe?

Flow of income vs accumulated stock of wealth

measuring count over time, don't forget about qualitative aspects (seat belts, better features)

GDP compared to very recent years more reflect products then vs 100 yrs ago

PROBLEM: previous years of declining prices are not reflected in stats,
PROBLEM: higher prices may mean higher quality

LESSON: older vs younger populations affect country output statistics: older requires medications

LESSON: government also can sell for less price, exaggerate value of gov. services

higher gdp per capita doesn't mean that living standards are higher

developing countries rise, then poor people who would've died now survive, increasing size of poor people, which could
actually drag down statistics

Fact: In colonial America, where hard currency was in short supply, warehouse receipts for tobacco circulated as money

-------------INFLATION AND DEFLATION------------------

During the later stages of the American Civil War, Southerners tended to use the currency issued in Washington, rather
than the currency of their own Confederate government.

inflation affects everyone, secretly taking away money

deflation causes mortagages and debts to cost more in relative terms

Federal reserve in the great depression acted strangely, RAISED INTEREST RATES????
Politicians may not care about finances, but may care about political interests
reducing wage rates to compensate for deflation, not done by hoover or fdr, made things worse
Price of farm products were maintained by hoover (maintain purchasing power of farmers), fdr, resulting in crops being destroyed in periods of starvation

Money facilitates transfer of wealth, no banks, countries are poor.

FRACTIONAL RESERVE BANKING

- bank a written checks to bank b, bank b written checks to bank a, banks just pay the difference between the two!

DEFINITION: degree to which an asset can be converted to cash while retaining value

In China, most savings go to gov. run banks, which are loaned to gov enterprises at low interest rates

State deposit insurance before federal deposit insurance.

Logic: branch banking previously disallowed, due to trying to prevent competition, means that most
customers are only in one area, greater risk

people who are insured may take greater risks.
LESSON: containing risk doesn't make it go away

---------------ROLE OF GOVERNMENT-------------
---> LAW AND ORDER

Corruption: beaureaucrats delay, can demand bribes, cost of business goes up, higher prices,
lower standard of living.

That's the real cost....

Fact: A survey by the World Bank found that the number of days required to start a new business ranged from less
than ten in prosperous Singapore to 155 days in poverty-stricken Congo

Discriminatory laws can promote econ. develop. if its spelled out in advance

LESSON: Property Rights create self monitoring, property rights are more valuable to people
who are not rich, since its economically efficient

In aggregate, the non rich often has far more money then rich??? Entrepreneurs
can borrow money, and use that to build middle class homes and apartments in rich neighborhoods,
thuse lowering property values of rich

---> SOCIAL ORDER

Trust is important in doing business
Overseas Chinese can make verbal agreements, without judicial legal system involved, thus
the cost of doing business is lower, an advantage.

Rent control can cause landlords to neglect or destroy their property, hoping they can sell the site
for other uses, thereby getting rid of costs and rent control

Consider government as an integral part, loses distinction between capability and intention
No present value factor to force political decision makers

No clear categorial definition as "clean water, or clean air"
LESSON: if gov keeps raising standards of purity, the costs may be more then benefits

SAYING: "Dose that makes the poison".

FDR used ww1 laws to take US off gold standard, politicians using laws differently compared to
their original intent

---------GOVERNMENT FINANCE-------------

Tax revenue and bond sales are biggest src of money for gov.
DEFINITION: national debt is what's owed by gov.

-----> GOVERNMENT REVENUES

government services and goods: transactions are transfers of tangible resources that
affect economic efficiency.

tax rate goes up, tax revenue may not

Tax rates vs tax revenues: gov can change tax rates, but revenue change depends on people
FALLACY: "500 billion tax cut or 700 billion tax increase".

DEFINE: regressive tax, affects lower income people more then higher

liability of paying taxes to gov. doesn't tell who bears the economic burden in the end.

tax laws are based on value expressed in money: inflation can make investment worth more even if it didn't earn anything

- purchaser of tax exempt gov. bonds has no interest in future goal of these bond spending
  Will have to pay bondholders nonetheless

Using eminent domain to destroy blighted housing and replace with commercial property with higher values

Kelo vs new London court case, allows for users to ask gov. officials to use eminent domain
to take property, sell it to new owners for less, no need to bid.

LESSON: Bonds or tax revenue? Future or current needs?

Foreigners hold US debt, can collect future wealth from future generations of americans

WW2: inflation meant that purchasing power of bonds when cashed in was less then the amount spent to
buy them.

LESSON: Look at debt relative to size of US economy, if gov has large financial liabilities, but not yet part of budget,
then the debt may be less then what gov. truly owes.

Transport Systems becoming municiapl, gov, owned. Resources whose value to people elsewhere were greater
were being sent to municipal transit due to taxpayer revenue and subsidies

National parks: national park fares go into us treasury, costs of maintain. paid by taxes, so the fares don't
have to be very high

CLAIM: services have to be obtainable from standpoint of "poor". Why would majority of population pay for
something that fewer people use? Vouchers are better...

Unemployment benefits and agricul. subsidies are entitilement programs, which are unpopular to repeal.

LESSON: Loss of purchasing power in once place offsets gain in purchasing power elsewhere

Keynesian economics, get an economy out of recession is for gov to do deficit spending, adds to monetary demand, leading
to more purchases, more hiring, and reduce unemployment.

BIG LESSON: Government programs cost: gov cost or economy cost?

LESSON: Legal penalties against gov may be little, but economic cost may be very big!

Land restrictions in the name of "open space" may reduce value because home builders are prevented from using the land
and don't bid for it.

-------> BENEFITS VS NET BENEFITS

Product X costs $10, but avg person only wants it for $6, then fewer are going to buy
Gov may subsidize this through $4 (bond sales, or taxes). Means that most people will pay $10
counting taxes and their own money to buy something now worth $6.

Even if now affordable for avg person, then half of population still won't be able to afford it,
so have to repeat the process.

Tax cuts for the rich phrase...

FALLACY: Congressional budget office issues projections provided by congress. If Congress is wrong, then the office will
make estimates based off of wrong assumptions, even if media or public consider it non partisan.

Wealth buys more education and time to be devoted into politics
Gov institutions are often in opposition to one another due to interests

Gov officials are pressured to "do something" even if it may make things worse

----> Government Obligations

Legal obligations to make future expenditures. Like gov bonds, or subsidies.

Gov. guarantees; costs nothing to taxpayers so may be celebrated, but if loans don't get repaid, then lots of taxpayer
money gets spent to cover costless guarantees

Easy to promise pensions, but unpopular politically to raise taxes to cover these pensions

LESSON: Private annuity invests premiums that come in, create investments that can pay dividends

Social security doesn't invest in anything. Gov bonds in social security only promise to pay money collected from
future taxpayers (no wealth is created)

Private annuity creates wealth that will pay for its own pension, but gov pensions pay currently retired using premiums paid by currently working.
Gov pensions are jeopardized by changing demographic

-----> MARKET FAILURE

Imperfection of market vs imperfection of gov.

2008: big banks had huge losses in loans, politicians were rarely blamed for making banks loan to bad creditors.
Then they get credit for making solutions to problems they created.

LESSON: Boeing abandoned concorde design once financial problems were known. Britain and France gov. didn't.

LESSON: Britain and France gov. created channel tunnel, while private ferry companies made their ferries bigger. Turns out that
the Channel tunnel was very bad financially.

----------INTERNATIONAL TRADE-----------

Intl. trade isn't 0 sum game: Both sides will benefit or else trade won't exist.
FAVORABLE VS UNFAVORABLE

NAFTA was good to US? # of US jobs increased after agreement

FALLACY: import surplus required diff. of import, export to be paid in gold, loss of gold will make country poor

Adam Smith the wealth of nations said that real wealth of nation consists of good and services, not gold supply
We had favorable trade during 1930's....

ABSOLUTE ADVANTAGE: 1 country can make things cheaper/better then others
COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE: country sacrifices less by shifting resources to production

ECONOMIC COSTS - foregone alternatives

EXAMPLE: britain focused on making goods based on compar. advantage, then using those money to buy food
, not worth for britain to grow its own food

FACT: Min output of automobiles to achieve good cost/car is between 200-400k a year

Intl trade is needed to achieve economies of scale

Restrictions: imports of things can create job losses

FALLACY: rich countries cannot compete with poorer countries (low wage) workers.

History and economics refute it. Britain in 19th entury and Dutch republic. India also had lower wage rates
then in more modern countries but its producers couldn't compete in terms of quality.

Wage rates vs labor costs vs total cost

Wage rates are measured per hour of work
labor costs - per unit of output
total cost - cost of labor but cost of other things needed to produce the product.

LESSON: When workers in a prosperous country receive wages twice as high as
workers in a poorer country and produce three times the output per hour, then
it is the high-wage country which has the lower labor costs per unit of output.

LESSON: restrictions on either domestic or international markets usually cost jobs on net balance because such
restrictions reduce the prosperity on which the demand for goods and labor
depends.

capital cheaper in rich countries.
Variety of laws and regulations designed to reduce imports, make things more $$

Infant industry - temporary protection although small companies rarely have money for such lobbying

FALLACY: countries "dump" goods onto the market at low prices, losing short term money to get
larger market share that they can exploit.

- are goods being sold for less then prod. costs?
- excuse made by domestic producers to hurt competitors
- just because prices are low doesn't mean selling below cost of producing these products

New jobs created may not attract political attention, vs losing jobs belonging to labor unions.

FALLACY: Outsourcing in both directions (net losses of jobs)...changes with time

outsource a lot, may have more jobs then otherwise, since more wealth = more jobs

It has been estimated that all the protectionism in the European Union countries
put together saves no more than a grand total of 200,000 jobs—at a cost of
$43 billion. That works out to about $215,000 a year for each job saved.

-------INTL TRANSFER OF WEALTH---------

remittances: money sent back home
FACT: some countries are poor because investing in it is risky

Trade deficits - what is the size relative to size of economy??

counting money flowing in and out, then you are talking about balance of payments(made or not), not trade

FACT: trade surplus doesn't mean prosperity

FALLACY: when people in other countries invest in the United States, that makes the U.S. a “debtor” to those people

Looked at in terms of things, there is nothing wrong with this, looked at in terms of
words, however, this was a growing debt to foreigners.

EXAMPLE: Every time you deposit a hundred dollars in a bank, that bank goes a hundred dollars deeper into debt,
because it is still your money and they owe it to you. On the contrary, the bank officials
would probably be delighted to get millions of dollars, from which they can
make more loans and earn more interest.

foreign investors send $$ to US on condition of dividends, US businessmen would never have agreed to pay
interest and dividends unless they expected these investments to produce big
enough returns

debtor / creditor nation are accounting problems, not determining prosperity.

FALLACY: foreign investors would carry off much of their national wealth, leaving the local population poorer
REFUTATION: Americans ought to be some of the poorest people in the world, but no.
The reason for that prosperity is that economic transactions are not a zero-sum
activity.

FALLACY: multinational corporations profit by “exploiting” workers in the Third World.
REFUTATION: why does the vast majority of American investments in other countries go to richer
countries, where high wage rates must be paid

Moreover, even within poor countries, the very poorest people are typically those with the least
contact with multinational corporations, often because they are located away
from the ports and other business centers.

But, in the modern industrial world at least, imperialism has seldom
been a major source of international transfers of wealth.

------> FOREIGN AID

- but in other cases foreign aid simply enables the existing politicians in power to enrich themselves through graft a
- foreign aid has encouraged many countries to set up government-run enterprises that have failed, or to create
  palaces, plazas or other things meant to impress on-lookers
- What needed to be rebuilt in Europe was physical capital. What needed to be created in much of the
  Third World was more human capital.

- Another phrase that presupposes an outcome which may or may not in
  fact materialize is the term “developing nations” for poorer nations, who
  may or may not be developing as fast as more prosperous nations, and in a
  number of cases have actually retrogressed economically over the years.

In short, many poor countries have already created substantial amounts of
physical wealth that is not legally recognized,

But the property rights system which makes this possible has not been as
accessible to ordinary people in Third World countries

FACT: But an estimated 90 percent of the wealth transfers to poorer nations from the
United States takes the form of private philanthropic donations, business
investments or remittances from citizens

----> INTL MONETARY SYSTEM

Where millions of dollars are invested overseas, the stability of the
various currencies is urgently important.

STRONG VS WEAK CURRENCY

A “strong” currency means that the prices of exports from
countries which use that currency have risen in price to people in other
countries.

FACT: When Norway’s krone rose in value relative to Sweden’s krona, Norwegians living
near the border of Sweden crossed over the border and saved 40 percent
buying a load of groceries in Sweden.

Currency can rise / fall at same time

INTL DISPARITIES IN WEALTH

- Was there ever any realistic chance that the
  nations of the world would have had similar prospects of economic
  development?

TAKEAWAY: The larger point here is that the effect of different geographic factors,
such as sunshine and rain, cannot be considered in isolation, because their
interactions are crucial and their timing is crucial.

shallow vs deep harbors

LESSON: To the direct economic benefits created by low transport costs on navigable waterways must be added the value of greater human capital
resulting from exposure to a wider cultural universe that includes the
products, technology and ideas of countries around the world.

POPULATIONS and IMPERIALISM

- poverty / famine have been far more common in thinly populated regions
- Spain looted through imperialism, but didn't use riches to improve itself

Takeaway: interactions of the physical world with changing human knowledge and varied human cultures which
help determine economic outcomes.

-Knowledge advanced, did more substances become natural resources unpredictably, changing
advantages of different regions.

- when modern transportation and communications penetrate that isolation, old cultures may not vanish

- Whether the payments received by those who contributed in these ways were unnecessarily large is a question
  answered by whether those same contributions are available from others at a
  lower cost.

- Physically identical things are often sold for different prices, usually
  because of accompanying conditions that are quite different.

- Price differences reflect differences in inventory costs, cost of land of store, ...
- Customer costs measured in shopping time varies...

------> REASONABLE OR AFFORDABLE PRICES

- Reasonable or affordable means adjusting economic realities to our budget, since we won't adjust to realities

LESSON: Brands are a way of economizing on scarce knowledge, and
of forcing producers to compete in quality as well as price.

Drive into a new town, brands help give you comfort and trust in what you do, reduce range of uncertainty
quality control is higher when brands are well known, brands have to maintain value of their brand

-------> NON PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS

- Non-profit organizations have additional sources of income, including
  fees from those who use their services, However, these fees do not cover the
  full costs of the goods and services being supplied

LESSON: leaders of non profits are in a position to substitute their own goals for institution's purpose
Difficult to establish foundation to serve a purpose after money has been spent and original founders are dead

universities: Widespread complaints today that professors neglect teaching
in favor of research, and sometimes neglect both in favor of leisure or other
activities, suggest that the underlying principle has not changed much in
more than two hundred years.

In whatever activities they engage, non-profit organizations are not under the same pressures to get “the most
bang for the buck” as are enterprises in which profit and loss determine their
survival.

If profits are unnecessary charges, then non profits should be doing better then profit groups

Colleges contract out operation: commercial businesses not only run such services at lower costs, they make
enough profit to pay the colleges more than these non-profit organizations
could make from the same operations on their own campuses.

profit-seeking enterprises reduce such waste as hiring year-round employees for highly seasonal
businesses like college bookstores

Non profit organizations have incentives to be alarmists in order to score money out of donors.

-----------NON-ECONOMIC-VALUES------------

Economics is not a value, its to weigh one value against each other.
Economics doesn't say to make most money as possible.

Non economic values viewpoint of the world - people want to save x, preserve, y and do z.
To people who think—or rather, react—in this way, economics is at best
a nuisance that obstructs them from doing what they have their hearts set on
doing

the world forces us into tradeoffs and undesirable choices, politicians will be more popular because
they promise the impossible.

High costly laws and policies designed to guard public from lethal hazards (if it saves just one human life, worth any cost)
Wealth can save lives: better buildings to withstand earthquakes etc..

How much life is being saved at what cost

CLAIM: no limit on value of human life, but no one would spend half of nation's gdp to keep someone alive for extra 20 sec.
Vaccinating children in 3rd world countries costs very little / child and saves many lives, but
heart transplant on 80 yr old is expensive and doesn't prolong as much life.

Financial analysts may be as sensitive to
the people they are serving as others are to the very different constituencies
they represent

magnanimous???

Because a given institution or process conveys a certain outcome does not
mean that it caused that outcome

People die more often in expensive hospitals since those hospitals take in the most ill patients.
The hospital didn't cause their deaths though.

In short, moral decisions depend on factual realities. However, people with different moral values can make different decisions about the same
facts. Therefore the policy question often comes down to whether some
people feel that their moral values should be imposed on other people with
different moral values through the power of government

Don't confuse privilege with achievements.

Morality is needed for a society to succeed, but are not sufficient by themselves.

---------HISTORY OF ECONOMICS-----

equilibrium theory, no economic transaction takes place in isolation.
Keynesian - gov intervene by spending to restore employment

Is economic scientific or just a set of opinions?
Do economic ideas reflect events and change with events?

Mathematical presentations make arguments more compact and easier to follow, make flaws harder to hide

Economics is scientific since it has some procedures of science (controlled experiments are impossible)

forecast vs predictions since there is uncertainty

But economics is ultimately about systemic results, not personal intentions or individual acts.

Does economics influence events and do events influence economics? Yes, but how?

George Stigler: “A war may ravage a continent or destroy a generation without posing new
theoretical questions.

wage rates per unit of time vs labor costs per unit of output
tax rates per dollar of income vs total tax revenues

Labor unions can increase labor's share of industry, but ruins competition for investment, leading to net loss
of jobs.

Much confusion comes from judging economic policies by the goals
they proclaim rather than the incentives they create.

What specific things are going to be done in the name of that goal?
What does the particular legislation or policy reward and what does it punish?
What constraints does it impose?

When people do not stop and think through the issues, it does not matter whether those
people are geniuses or morons, because the quality of the thinking that they
would have done is a moot point.

Understanding facts not enough, implications need to be thought of, ex: Eastman Kodak

economies are ways of production and distribution of goods / services, efficiently or not, voluntary or not.

Yet invidious comparisons and internecine struggles are the stuff of social
melodrama, which in turn is the lifeblood of the media and politics, as well
as portions of the intelligentsia.

Zero sum thinking can result in negative sum contests.
Economics not as emotional satisfying as drama in issues found in media and politics.
