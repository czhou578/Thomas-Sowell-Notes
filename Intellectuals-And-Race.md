DEFINITION: Race is a social concept with a biological basis.

**Big question**, how do we confront race?

Put US's racial/ethnic issues in an intl context. This
neither assumes nor denies the uniqueness of American racial and ethnic
issues, but lets that be an empirical question.

Take asian americans into considerations, whites are let go from jobs before asians.

disparities often treated as oddities with no historial precedent.

**Fact**: Bank of Italy was set up to attract clients who were italian and were very good at repaying debts,
this bank became BofA.

**Big Question**: Was there ever any realistic chance that the various races would have had the
same skills, experience and general capabilities, even if they had the same
genetic potential and faced no discrimination?

geographic barriers: Western europe has geographic advantages compared to eastern europe.
Literacy moved from Western to eastern europe

and neither could the people in those places have developed the same industrial
skills, habits and ways of life

Median Age differences mean differences in experience, knowledge

Irish immigrants arrived in the nineteenth century, and cholera outbreaks in
New York and Philadelphia went largely through Irish neighborhoods. People didn't want to live near Irish...

## Intellectuals Quotes about Race.

- Francis Walker - proposed that immigrants pay $100 downpayment on entering country, He said that the restrictions he proposed “would not
  prevent tens of thousands of thrifty Swedes, Norwegians, Germans, and men
  of other nationalities coming hither at their own charges, since great numbers
  of these people now bring more than that amount of money with them.

- Richard Ely, progressive: favored government and rejected free market economics.

- Harvard economist Taussig: those saturated with alcohol
  or tainted with hereditary disease,” as well as “the irretrievable criminals and
  tramps.”

- In response to a British historian who expressed a fear that the
  black and yellow races would rise in the world to the point of challenging the
  white race, Theodore Roosevelt said: “By that time the descendant of the
  negro may be as intellectual as the Athenian.”

Progressive economists advocated minimum wage laws, as a way of preventing “low-wage races” such as
Chinese immigrants from lowering the standard of living of American
workers.

Woodrow Wilson (president) showed KKK films in White House, gov segregated employees at his time.

It is not necessary to believe that crime rates are genetically determined, but it is also not necessary to believe that it
was all just a matter of perceptions by whites.

## INTERNAL RESPONSES TO DISPARITIES

In some countries today, any claim that intergroup differences in outcomes are results of intergroup differences
in skills, behavior or performance are dismissed by the intelligentsia as false
“perceptions,” “prejudices,” or “stereotypes,” or else are condemned as
“blaming the victim.

**International Example**: latvian educated class resented successful Germans and promoted unique latvian identity
Habsburg empire: germans were elite, and czechs were not. But a new Czech intelligentsia, including university students and
school teachers, promoted Czech cultural nationalism.

Germans resisted efforts initially to fragment society along ethnic lines, but were eventually forced to
defend themselves, causing ethnic polarization (under social justice).

Similar polarization has been produced in other countries with the rise of a
newly educated intelligentsia— usually educated in “soft” fields

**Big Quote**: “The very elites who
were thought to be leading their peoples away from ethnic affiliations were
commonly found to be in the forefront of ethnic conflict.

surplus academic proletariat which could not be absorbed into “economically or socially functional
employment” because they were trained primarily in law or the humanities

**Big Quote**: Historian A.J.P. Taylor has said that the first stage of nationalism “is led
by university professors” and that “the second stage comes when the pupils
of the professors get out into the world.

third world leaders went to west to study social theories, causing home countries to stagnate or even regress.

All this was part of the price paid for seeking cosmic justice for intertemporal abstractions, in a world where
maintaining peace and civility among flesh-and-blood contemporaries is
often a major challenge by itself.

**Big Picture**: disparity in wealth is a result, not a cause. like if Group A has higher incomes then group B, then its group B's fault... intelligentsia downplays achievements by transforming it into "privilege"

LESSON: principles are less important then fashions

## RACE AND INTELLIGENCE

mental potential/native intelligence - IQ at birth

Could there be induced differences in average mental potential or average developed capabilities in a
given race?

QUESTION: magnitude and the duration of whatever differences in either intellectual
potential or developed capabilities that may exist as of a given time?

Claim: Tallest men sent to war and died, lowers average height of a country, and lowers potential for height of future
generations.

Some have said that Jews who survived thousands of years of persecutions had to be more ingenious, explaining
why a lot of jews are intellectuals

FACTS: Genes of less successful members of a particular race become a growing proportion of all the genes passed on to subsequent generations can
reduce the average hereditary potential of the race as a whole.

This is caused by: policies subsidizing such lifestyle, and internal culture of laziness.
Some groups may refuse to be dependents and escape consequences of this lifestyle

hereditary and environmental theories are not sealed off, since environment can influence survival rate of hereditary Characteristics
No real way to measure potential of individuals at moment of conception.

When hiring: What has been the track record of a particular test in predicting subsequent
performances— both absolutely and in comparison with alternative criteria?

STUDY DONE ON IQ: A long-range study by Lewis Terman, beginning in 1921, followed children with IQs of 140 and above in their later lives and found that those
children who came from homes where the parents were less educated, and were from a lower socioeconomic level, did not achieve prominence in their
own lives as often as other children in the same IQ range who had the further
advantage of coming from homes with a higher cultural level.

Being mismatched to the particular university that has admitted them for diversity reasons.

Groups that score low on abstract questions in IQ tests.

FALLACY: group differences in scores on these tests are due primarily to the words used in these tests or to the
culturally loaded subjects in the questions.

```
REFUTATION: these groups may not be interested in abstractions in their lives.
Also, what are the tests supposed to be for? These skills are needed in many careers in this world.
A culture-free test might be appropriate in a culture-free society— but there are no such societies.
```

1st tie forced to accept 2nd tier, 2nd tier accept 3rd tier, domino effect.

Not useful to single out a racial group's IQ for comparison with natl. avg, since it creates implication of uniqueness.

The fervor and persistence of the racial IQ debate cannot be assumed to be a measure of its practical implications,\* as distinguished from its ideological
importance for competing social visions.

Black subculture has had negative effect on academic achievement.
FALLACY: what is needed in educational institutions is some larger “critical mass” of black students, in order to make them feel socially
comfortable and thus able to do their best work academically.

FACT: In other words, highability minority youngsters do better in classes that are intellectually
homogeneous, rather than racially homogeneous.

VOCAB: vituperation

## LIBERALISM AND MULTICULTURALISM

An American Dilemma, 1944 book, mentions that American racial policies, especially in
the South, marked a glaring contradiction between the nation’s fundamental
founding principles of freedom and equality and its actual practices as regards blacks

Premise that racial problem was one inside minds of whites, simplified task of intelligentsia

Progressives shifted from eugenics to racism. If minorities were
seen as the problem before, the majority was seen as the problem now.

No empical evidence: For example, the number of blacks lynched in the entire history of the United States would be a fraction of the Armenians
slaughtered by Turkish mobs in one year in the Ottoman Empire

Prevents understanding that internal or cultural values could have a role in racial disparities or gaps.

FOREIGN EVIDENCE: Writing about lower-class whites in British public housing projects, Dr. Theodore Dalrymple observed: “The public spaces and elevators
of all public housing blocks I know are so deeply impregnated with urine that
the odor is ineradicable. And anything smashable has been smashed.

FACT: 1967 poll found that 68 percent of blacks said that they had more to lose than
to gain from rioting

FACT: After the Rodney King riots in 1992, 58 percent of blacks condemned those riots, while only 32 percent found the violence even
partially justified.

Justification for racism: group that is to be discriminated against
was too proficient for others to compete with on equal terms, for whatever
reason

EXAMPLE: For example, most blacks were not residentially segregated in such cities as New York, Chicago,
Detroit, Philadelphia, and Washington by the end of the nineteenth century

a causal analysis of the major changes that occurred in residential and other restrictions on blacks cannot explain such
changes by simply saying “racism.

## MULTICULTURALISM

Before civil rights act of 1964, somce places prevented race from being recorded on job applications.

multiculturalism -> particular cultures found among less fortunate groups are not to be blamed for disparities in
income, education, crime rates, or family disintegration.

Ex: black vernacular, speak snglish then spanish in schools.
usage of the word "diversity" without a speck of evidence.

LESSON: Treating races as intertemporal abstractions enables those with this vision to treat discrimination against contemporary whites as somehow
offsetting discrimination against blacks in the past

It is as if blacks arrived in the United States from Africa with the same skills as those of whites who arrived
here from Europe.

discrimination and cancer both exists, but intergroup differences cannot be assumed to be due to discrimination any more than deaths can be assumed to be due to cancer.

## RACE AND COSMIC JUSTICE

social justice is more like cosmic justice: since it seeks to undo disparities created by circumstances, as well as those
created by the injustices of human beings.

FACT: environment is said to be the surroundings today, when the legacy of the past may be an equal or greater influence.

multiculturalism seals off grouops from others, groups who may have things to learn from other groups.
differences -> inequities -> evils of society.

transforming negative facts about a group into perceptions of society.
“are expected to think and act in white ways”

Apparently people are to think and behave as they have in the past and yet somehow get better results in the
future? — and, if they don’t get better results, that is considered to be society’s
fault.

achieve same results as others without having to change, in order to acquire same cultural prereqs as others acquired without changing, would be cosmic justice.

**LESSON**: caste system preaches resignation to one’s fate and multiculturalism preaches resentment of one’s fate

“blaming the victim.” - confuses blame with causation.
EVIDENCE: less educated blacks moving to northern cities ruined race relations (couldn't be blamed for being born in the south)
but it doesn't absolve them from their role in worse changes.

seeing fleshand-blood contemporaries as simply part of an intertemporal abstraction, so an injustice against them would offset
other injusticies of the past.

FALLACY: system that is causing the problem

```
REFUTATION: clearly something in circumstances that makes it more likely for blacks to commit crimes, but that doesn't tell us
what something is.

```

social justice -> anti social justice, sacrificing innocent people's wellbeing.

FALLACY: The fact that so many black families today consist of women with fatherless children has been said by many to be a legacy of slavery,

```
REFUTATION: Yet most black children grew up in two-parent families, even under slavery itself, and
for generations thereafter.

```

## THE FALSE DICHOTOMY

Members of lagging groups who take this dichotomy seriously must either confess to being inferior, or blame others for it.
Members of more fortunate groups are left with a choice between arrogance and guilt, when confronted with the false dichotomy
gaps are unlikely to close within a lifetime.

## Race Industry

NAACP, ethnic studies departments / programs. Legal profession represeted in racial issues.
diversity consultants in private industry, community organizers in ethnic neighborhoods..

Policies may enhance the race industry itself, without benefitting the people.

## Affirmative Action

Often times, these programs have expiration date, but that almost always keeps getting extended, and never ended.

The distinction is fundamental between saying that statistical disparities
found at a particular institution are caused by that institution, rather than
saying that these disparities convey disparities that originate outside that
institution.

Another way of saying the same thing is that different groups may fail to meet relevant standards for any
number of possible reasons. But the burden of proof is put on the accused

Can make accusations of racism against banks, banks pay money, accusation withdrawn.

In a decade, more than a trillion dollars have been extracted from financial and other
business organizations by community activist organizations, using a variety
of tactics, according to the National Community Reinvestment Coalition

equality -> inequities -> discrimination, equality is not automatic!!!

Tracing intergroup differences is long with little emotional benefit. Instead, the powerful think they are superior
and the weak think they are opressed; has destroyed many societies.

Peace is so hard to maintain and rare, why would we always force future gen. to redress issues between our dead ancestors?

Many of what are called social problems are differences between the
theories of intellectuals and the realities of the world
