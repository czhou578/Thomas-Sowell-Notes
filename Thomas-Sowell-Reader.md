To be for or against “change” in general is childish.
Everything depends on the specifics. To be for generic
“change” is to say that what we have is so bad that any change
is likely to be for the better.

Such a pose may make some people feel superior to others

Duty to die: is that what old people need?

Today, it is the children and grandchildren who
move in with the grandparents.

People don’t usually grow up when there are other people
who make excuses for their immaturity

People make choices and have their own priorities—and
adults take responsibilities for their choices and priorities.

“How would you feel if you were a Native American who saw
the European invaders taking away your land?” is the kind of
question our children are likely to be confronted with in our
schools. It is a classic example of trying to look at the past with
the assumptions—and the ignorance—of the present.

This is an academic community where indignation is a way of
life. Those engaged in moral exhibitionism have no time for
mundane realities.

The anointed want to eliminate stress, challenge, striving,
and competition. They want the necessities of life to be
supplied as “rights”—which is to say, at the taxpayers’ expense,
without anyone’s being forced to work for those necessities,
except of course the taxpayers.

History is what happened, not what we wish had happened or
what a theory says should have happened. One of the reasons
for the great value of history is that it allows us to check our
current beliefs against hard facts from around the world and
across the centuries. But history cannot be a reality check for today’s fashionable
visions when history is itself shaped by those visions

Too many computer and software producers seem to think
that being condescending to the user is the same as
simplifying.

An old saying is that we are once a man and twice a child.

Women may lie about their age to other people but men lie
about their age to themselves.

Domestic service has lifted people out of poverty, some of the most
urgently needed workers are those who can do simple things
reliably and conscientiously.

First of all, you cannot retrain people who have not been trained in the first place, who
didn’t bother to learn in school, and who have never developed
a sense of responsibility.

To the anointed, the use of words like “rights” is sufficient to
put one coterie’s opinions above discussion and the word
“stereotypes” is enough to put the values of the society at large
beneath discussion.

When it is a right to “decent housing,” for example, that means other people have a duty to
produce that housing and supply it to you—whether or not you
are willing to pay what it costs.

Our award-winning teacher had a sign on her classroom wall
saying, “Question Authority.” Today, there is barely enough
authority around to question.

A quarter of a century before the Gettysburg Address, Abraham Lincoln said
in a speech in Springfield, Illinois, that the greatest danger to
the future of the United States would come, not from foreign
enemies, but from that class of people which “thirsts and burns
for distinction.

Think beyond step 1. 

The most fundamental fact about labor unions is that they do
not create any wealth.

Greater wealth for coal miners, raises price of coal, leads to mass adoption of other tech, phasing out coal.

That is why government unions continue to thrive while
private sector unions decline. Taxpayers provide their free
lunch.

Affordable, healthcare is a right. History in fact shows all too many
instances of governments trying to keep food affordable,
usually with disastrous consequences. Whether in France during the 1790s, the Soviet Union after
the Bolshevik revolution, or in newly independent African
nations during the past generation, governments have imposed
artificially low prices on food. In each case, this led to
artificially low supplies of food and artificially high levels of
hunger.

Crime is one of those occupations, like sports and entertainment, in
which a relatively few at the top achieve very high incomes,
while most of those who enter the occupation receive very low
incomes. 

Private bail bondsman. 
indicted criminals can pay a bail bondsman to post a
bond in their behalf to guarantee their appearance in court on
their trial date, so that they can stay out of jail pending trial.

If criminal doesn't show up, bondsmen or bounty hunters are authorized to go
capture those who do not show up in court.

American Mafia leaders have generally treated their organizations as businesses primarily concerned
with making money. Killing law enforcement officials, in this
view, would only draw unwanted scrutiny.

While biases and prejudices are conditions in people’s minds,
discrimination is an overt act taking place outside their minds
in the real world. 

In short, the costs of translating subjective attitudes, such as bias or
prejudice, into overt acts of discrimination cannot be
overlooked when seeking to explain why discrimination is often
so much greater in some situations than in others.

But investing statistical data with moral angst does nothing to establish a
connection between a transient cohort in statistical categories
and an enduring class conjured up through verbal virtuosity.

The fact that one person’s productivity may be a thousand
times as valuable as another’s does not mean that one person’s
merit is a thousand times as great as another’s.

“A war may ravage a continent or
destroy a generation without posing new theoretical
questions,” 

In politics, throwing the taxpayers’ money at disasters is
supposed to show your compassion. But robbing Peter to pay
Paul is not compassion. It is politics.

If you are not even willing to put the taxpayers’ money where
your mouth is, there is something wrong somewhere.

If the restrictions’ benefits to “society” outweigh the losses to
the owner, then it makes sense to pay the money and
everybody ends up better off. But when you confiscate property
by the back door, you can just say some lofty words and keep
going. You don’t have to weigh anything against anything.

One of the greatest economic moves we could make would be
to pay every member of Congress a million dollars a year, but
with no perks and no pension. Paying this salary to each
member of Congress for the entire 21st century would cost less
than running the Department of Agriculture for one year.

Why are leftists able to crowd out other kinds of people from
these places? Because those who are willing to subject
themselves to the test of reality, whether as a businessman in
the marketplace or as a surgeon in an operating room, have
many other places in which to work and live. They do not need
special sheltered niches in which to hide and to cherish their
precious notions.

The Crisis
The Solution
The Results
The Response 

John F. Kennedy stated the purpose of the “war on poverty”
to be “to help our less fortunate citizens to help themselves.

Public welfare, in short, must be more than a salvage
operation, picking up the debris from the wreckage of human
lives. Its emphasis must be directed increasingly toward
prevention and rehabilitation—on reducing not only the longrange cost in budgetary terms but the long-range cost in
human terms as well.

As these programs got underway, the mayors of Los Angeles, San
Francisco, and Detroit blamed the “war on poverty” for
“fostering class struggle

Fertility rates among teenage girls had been
declining for more than a decade since 1957. Venereal
disease was also declining. The rate of infection for
gonorrhea, for example, declined every year from 1950 through
1959, and the rate of syphilis infection was, by 1960, less than
half of what it had been in 1950.

Sex ed did nothing and just made things worse?

Sweeping presumptions about the
irrationality and mean-spiritedness of the public were made
without either evidence or a sense of need for evidence.

An alternative to denying rising crime rates was to make it
socially unacceptable to talk about it, by equating discussions
of “law and order” with racism, since it was well known that
crime rates were higher among blacks. “Law and order” was
“an inflammatory statement,” according to the well-known
psychiatrist Karl Menninger.

What is the cost of turning criminals loose? Phrases like “intensive probation” may
create the illusion that criminals at large are somehow under
control of the authorities but illusions are especially dangerous
when it comes to crime.

In the United States, the cost of incarcerating a criminal has
been estimated as being $10,000 a year less than the cost of
turning him loose.

Political catch-phrases like “a
woman’s right to do what she wants with her own body” cannot
be applied to situations where a baby is killed at the very
moment when he ceases to be part of his mother’s body.

American zealots for the Brady Bill say nothing
about the fact that the man who shot James Brady and tried to
assassinate President Reagan has been out walking the streets
on furlough.

Two centuries ago, British statesman Edmund Burke warned
of the dangers to any society that promotes the idea that some
of its citizens are the natural prey of others.

Byzantines, Romans, Ottomans developed bureaucracies so suffocating and corrupt as to bring
their eras of glory to an end.

America does not raise children. It has never raised children.
And it is never going to raise children. No amount of verbal
collectivization will ever change that reality.

That is exactly what is wrong with “racial profiling” statistics.
It is based on blacks as a percentage of the population, rather
than blacks as a percentage of the people who do the kinds of
things that cause police to stop people and question them.

Judges have made it increasingly difficult for American
society to protect itself from anyone or anything, by creating
new “rights” out of thin air and by leaning over backward for
the benefit of those with anti-social behavior.

It is much easier to imitate the
outward institutional forms of Western democracy than to
synthesize the centuries of traditions that make those
institutions work.

Where the Constitution of the United States is a barrier to
this expanded role of judges, then judges have been urged to
“interpret” the Constitution as a set of values to be applied as
judges choose, or updated as they think appropriate, rather
than as a set of specific instructions to be followed. That is
what “judicial activism”

Incentives favor judicial activism, rewards and constraints.

Judges, like intellectuals, usually become famous among the
general public only when they step out beyond the bounds of
their professional competence to become philosopher-kings
deciding social, economic or political issues. 

” Practitioners of judicial restraint are seeking to understand and apply the
written law as it stands—as instructions for both judges and
the citizenry—not discover the motivations, beliefs, hopes or
fears that might have been behind the writing of the law.

Saying that it is hard or impossible to discern what was
meant by a law has often been a prelude to making decisions
that ignore even the plainest meanings

There was nothing esoteric about the phrase “an establishment of religion.” For
more than a hundred years after the Constitution was written,
it never meant that it was illegal to display religious symbols on
government property.

But to defer to those whose powers the
Constitution specifically limited would be to make a mockery of
those limitations. If Congress itself is to decide how far its
powers extend, what purpose can there be in Constitutional
limitations on the power of Congress or of the federal
government?

The word “minority” had already
become one of many politically corrupted words. It no longer
meant a statistically smaller part of the population. It meant
people you feel sorry for.

Very often, the key ingredient in
the rise of explosive resentments is the rise of an intelligentsia
preoccupied with invidious comparisons rather than general
well-being.

Black and white employees who were watching the same TV
programs at home the previous night, and perhaps eating the
same junk food at the mall during lunchtime, are taught to
think of each other as exotic creatures from different worlds—
unable to understand each other, except with the painful and
expensive help of “diversity consultants.”

The high cost of knowledge is often overlooked when
discussing social policies, and especially social policies in the
emotionally charged area of race and ethnicity.
Racists may prefer their own group to others, but they prefer
themselves most of all.

Yet people around the world do not simply
“celebrate diversity,” they pick and choose which of their own
cultural features they want to keep and which they want to
dump in favor of something better from somebody else.

Booker T. Washington took no such public stance and
instead directed his efforts toward the internal selfdevelopment of blacks in things ranging from personal hygiene
to saving, farm management, and the establishment of
businesses.

Initially, the term “affirmative action”
arose in the United States from an executive order by President
John F. Kennedy, who called for “affirmative action to ensure
that the applicants are employed, and that employees are
treated during employment without regard to race, color,
creed, or national origin.

A later executive order by President
Lyndon Johnson in 1968 contained the fateful expressions
“goals and timetables” and “representation.

Equality of opportunity might
be achieved within some feasible span of time, but that is
wholly different from eliminating inequalities of results.

People designating themselves as another race to take advantage of preferential
policies.

Another individual response to preferential policies has been
to use someone genuinely of the qualifying ancestry as a
“front” for businesses seeking preferential treatment in the
awarding of government contracts 

In some countries, complete physical withdrawal from the
country by those in non-preferred groups has occurred in the
wake of preferential policies which reduced their prospects.

Yet black police sergeants promoted in
Chicago over white policemen with higher test scores—as a
result of a court order—found themselves taunted as “quota
sergeants” when they made mistakes

 In even the worst of the worst schools, typically in
low-income and minority neighborhoods, the teachers unions
bitterly oppose letting even a fraction of the students go to
private schools with vouchers.

Even more revealing, there is a systematic relationship
between the difficulty of the subject and the percentage of
American doctorates which go to Americans.

Stanford University’s law school, for example, sends students
and others over to the nearby ghetto in East Palo Alto to fight
against the expulsion of hoodlums from the public school
system there. 

Much that is done in the name of “service” not only fails to
advance the development of thinking skills but positively
hinders it by substituting emotionally indelible but superficial
experiences.

real life is not prearranged by academic institutions.

You can find a four-leaf clover faster than you can
find a Republican in most sociology departments or English
departments.

Late adolescence and early adulthood are among the most
dangerous times in people’s lives, when one foolish decision
can destroy everything for which parents and children have
invested time and efforts and hopes for years.

There is no need to abolish college admissions committees,
social workers or teachers. But their roles need to be kept
within much narrower and more defined bounds.

They got this way, in large part, because of the vast sums of
money made available for research by federal and state
governments.

Unfortunately, colleges and universities have become bloated
with research money, spawning all sorts of expensive
boondoggles and layers of bureaucracy to oversee the
boondoggles.
