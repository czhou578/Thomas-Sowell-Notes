- czech nationalists treated germans like jews after may 1945 (germans had to wear stars on their shirts just like jews), expelled
from countries, many died
- germans produced best generals but also pacifist groups like the mennonites
- cultural persistence came from a loyalty to the particular subculture of locality, not loyalty to germany
- assimilation with other cultures didn't come naturally. 
- germans value education, US colleges modeled after them
- britain and neighbors taught germans, and germans ended up surpassing them.
- autocratic government had long been a norm in germany

----------------------------------------HITLER----------------------------------------------

- no such excitement of the german people for war at the starting of ww2
- hitler embraced foreign ethnic germans until they clashed with him. He pressured them to accept italian fascist rule
- when hitler complained about foreign treatment of germans, these germans abroad were pressured not to move back to germany
- nazi's failed to infiltrate foreign german communities

showed no such loyalty to Germany as a nation

- planned parenthood was created to limit # of black babies born

- hitler's racism was talked about at upper intellectual levels for many years

other times.
- political apathy of germans & law abiding habits allowed hitler to go beyond his original goals, combined with a strong military
tradition made him dangerous
- message to all people about dangers of being charmed by charisma or aroused by rhetoric
- productivity doesn't imply popularity

- dunbar high school, scored better then schools with white students
- students were not middle class and not light-skinned as claimed
- mary jane patterson, first black women with college degree in american history
- school had phd's and well qualified black teachers

- CLAIM: standardized tests do not predict future performances for minority kids: WRONG

- at one point, dunbar high grads didn't need to take entrance exams to be admitted into harvard (reputation was so good)
- most blacks with phd's had come from dunbar (1970's study)
- brown vs board of education (public schools into neighborhood schools)
- dunbar high ruined by educational politics
- st augustine catholic high, in new orleans (similar to dunbar)
- immigrant children growing up were embarassed when parents showed up at school

- more parent involvement in schools have never been essential throughout history for academic success

- jaimie escalante (taught math to mexican american students)(25% of all latino kids in the US who passed ap calc came from his school)
- educational dogmas are barriers and their upholders don't pay a price for student achievement or failure
- educational results are bad, protests can destroy their careers and their agendas
- blaming only the environment outside of school for bad performance is not the right way

- diversity = better learning environment doesn't have evidence. Japan is very homegenous yet is educated far better then US
- that black kids need an "afro-centric" education has not been proven with evidence either
- no evidence that same sex, same ethnicity models are as effective then white male role models at college level
- studies show that education of black students has been negatively affected by large numbers of other black students
- there is anti intellectual black subculture that prevents learning
- it was illegal for free blacks to go to school
- Most of 500k free blacks in 1850 could read/write

- in beginning, parents of these students usually preferred skills of white teachers to symbolism of black representation
- black admins at black colleges, made qualified black students to be seen as rivals and not to be treasured
- black leadership tolerated black redneck culture and other bad things (cultural change)

- CONSEQUENCE: when top schools accepted black students qualified for 2nd tier schools, 2nd tier schools accepted blacks qualified for 3rd tier etc.
- many blacks failed to graduate
- sacrificing academics for representation
- 87 to 47 percent black family poverty rate 1940-1960
- most black progress happened before civil rights movements
- “cultivate their brains more and their lungs less." - frederick douglass

- failure attracts more money and more programs, great for politicians who want to look kind
- badly performing students are like extras 
- whites walk on eggshells for fear of called racist, while blacks worry about their image, instead of their future

---------------------------------------------------History versus Visions----------------------------------------------------

- achievement, which is antithetical to the multiculturalism vision, which is then downplayed
- doing this sacrifices material interests of millions for ideological interests of a few
- Where the prevailing vision is one of external causation, verbal ingenuity often seeks to banish internal explanations
- prevailing vision is always blaming someone else, talking and mashing words together seeks to absolve itself from fault
- achievements are described as "advantages" or "privileges".
- this results in difference in outcomes are treated as difference in opportunity
- beating adversity is an even bigger threat to the prevailing vision, both achievement and adversity must be talked about 
in terms of advantages to fit the vision
- opportunity or access, and any adverse info is turned into myths and stereotypes
- meaning of prejudice: prejudgement
- dispelling prejudice glosses over many years of social struggles to assimilate foreigners into our country and values.
- maybe groups changed and improved themselves over time? Never mentioned.....
- we cannot ignore internal aspects of those seeking achievement or external aspects of surrounding world
- 1920, more japanese americans working as servants then blacks

------------------------------------SCOTLAND AND JAPAN-----------------------------------------------------

- scotland was conquered by england, a very backward place
- scotland adapted english and their progress took off.
- same thing happened with japan
- japan's leaders held the US as a standard, and english was once considered to be the national language of japan
- upheld US figures more highly then japan
- rate of mortality of blacks after emancipation was higher then it had been during slavery
- economic advancement was faster before civil rights movement then after
- rejecting internal change due to "self-hate" prevents progress and not justified by facts
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------MAJORITY INJUSTICES, MORAL VS CAUSAL---------------------------------------------

- claim: economic contrasts were based on injusticies on minorities by majorities
- if injustice, it extends beyond gov. or society because it involves a group's own history and culture
- lamenting fate induces helplessness, and a desire to transform cosmic justice into social justice
- because humans have infinite sins, there is never a lack of reason to blame
- moral vs causal: 

- Claim: immigrants from australia take land from natives, became rich.
WRONG: if immigration didn't happen, then whites would still be richer then austr. natives, so taking land away doesn't explain it because
it was the case in the first place.
- statistical disparities are not evidence of either the existence or the magnitude of those sins
- Inherited cultural advantages and disadvantages are windfall gains and windfall losses.
- merit is a moral category and confusing morality with causation is a fatal weakness in trying to understand history.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------CONQUESTS AND THE WESTERN VALUES------------------------------------------------
- europe has been conquered many times
- european conquests are similar to indigenous conquests all over the world
- how would you feel questions are posed, which ruin history education
- the history of conquests have been determined by who was in position to do so
- west has created two fundamental mental products: universalistic conception of human beings, and rule of law
- queen victoria wept over uncle tom's cabin, example of international unity to a cause 
- king charles 1 was beheaded, no one is above the law; king charles 2 fled the country. Most other parts of the world
would never see this happen
- selective adoption is different then saying "export democracy" since democracy took many years to involve
- attempt to make sins of human race look like problems specific to the west
- promotion into the past of current notions and agendas is very dangerous

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- LESSON: But history cannot be a reality check for visions when history is itself shaped by visions.
- honesty is attainable, but quite absent


- want mathematicians to be objective is impossible, but 1 + 1 is 2 no matter what
- if i write 1 = 0, i cannot give excuse that objectivity is impossible
- if you are objective, others may not know
- tell the story of "x" from the viewpoint of "y", impossible, since "y" are the only ones with that knowledge
- if we hate war, that doesn't mean people in the past who suffered in wars, hated it.
-  Does the fact that we cannot eliminate 100 percent of the impurities in air or water mean that we should celebrate smog or polluted
water and boast of our realism?
- Neither indictments nor apologies are the same as understanding.
- Yet, time and again, that liberation has been followed almost immediately by the liberated
peoples oppressing the minorities now subject to their power.
- right of self determination and breaking up of empires have led to violent minority wars in newly formed countries 
- The very word “racism” was then redefined to exclude groups without “power”


- looking at history as a matter of taking sides encourages collectivization of people, groups over time become abstractions
- this is very bad, just like for example cultures fighting for "injustices" many years prior
- dog in the manger mentality: good fortune of others is grievance to be avenged or prevented, even if it hurts yourself doing that
- southern nigerians forced out even though not enough qualified northern nigerians
- (taking sides in history) general forcing of historical patterns into a preconceived pattern based on ideological vision
- (taking sides in history) many then see strong group solidarity as a prerequisite for the victory of the side they have chosen.

- often means letting the lowest common denominator shape the culture and life within the group and determine the direction of its future.
- automatic criticism of police, or black students accused of being white
- means absorbing enormous costs imposed on the rest of the community 
- it has long been the practice of black Americans to “protect any Negro from the whites, even when they happen not to like that individual
Negro
- Group solidarity may not only seal a group off from the larger surrounding society, it may seal them off from the truth about the
internal causes of their own problems, making a solution more remote.

- though these outsiders pay no part of any of those costs—and so have little or no incentive to scrutinize their social vision and its
assumptions to discover their actual effects.

- kind of like celebrities with black lives matter apologizing
- "role models": ” Efforts to find, praise or exaggerate the numbers and achievements of these role models can be 
counterproductive by insinuating the idea that people can be inspired only by others who physically resemble themselves.

- NOT TRUE: japan learned most from europeans and americans, jewish children were taught largely by catholic teachers in 19th century
- result of a desperate desire of whites to avoid being considered racists and a desperate desire of blacks to avoid being considered inferior.

- people of a variety of ancestries, in countries around the world, have had average IQ scores at
the same level as that of blacks in the United States.

- national performances on IQ tests have risen substantially over the years in more than
a dozen countries, with black Americans at the end of the twentieth century answering as many IQ test questions correctly as
whites answered in the middle of that century.

- this ruins genetic determinism argument
- when newborn babies enter the world with pre-packaged grievances against other babies born the same day.

- To be relevant to our times, history must not be controlled by our times. Its integrity as a record of the past is what allows us
to draw lessons from it. 

- sinhalese and tamil minority in sri lanka, used to be a model for ethnic harmony, then broke into terrible civil war
- In Germany in the 1920s, Jews were so widely accepted socially that nearly half of all Jewish marriages in Germany during
that decade were marriages with non-Jews.

- knowledge has passed through filters and verifications, notions haven't
- The key factor in these calamities has often been a blocking of feedback from reality, epitomized by the
figurative or literal killing of messengers bringing bad news.
- Heedless of the past, we are flying blind into the future.


- excogitate: think out, plan, or devise.
