however narrowly that may be circumscribed, and the belief that it is desirable that men should develop their own individual gifts and bents. 

The subsequent elaboration of a consistent argument in favor of economic freedom was the outcome of a free growth of economic activity which
had been the undesigned and unforeseen by-product of political freedom.

There is nothing in the basic principles of liberalism to make it a stationary creed; there are no hard-and-fast rules fixed once and for all.

we should make as much use as possible of the spontaneous forces of society, and resort as little as possible to
coercion, is capable of an infinite variety of applications.

Because of the success already achieved, man became increasingly unwilling to tolerate the evils still with him which now
appeared both unbearable and unnecessary.

The French writers who laid the foundations of modern socialism had no doubt that their ideas could be
put into practice only by a strong dictatorial government.

It was to bring “economic freedom,” without which the political freedom already gained was “not worth having.” 

Max Eastman, Lenin’s old friend, who found himself compelled to admit that “instead of being better, Stalinism is worse than fascism

What the promise really amounted to was that the great existing disparities in the range of choice of different people were
to disappear. The demand for the new freedom was thus only another name for the old demand for an equal distribution of wealth.

That democratic socialism, the great utopia of the last few generations, is not only unachievable, but that to strive for it produces something so utterly different that
few of those who now wish it would be prepared to accept the consequences.

In this sense socialism means the abolition of private enterprise, of private ownership of the means of production, and the creation of a
system of “planned economy” in which the entrepreneur working for profit is replaced by a central planning body.

The dispute about socialism has thus become largely a dispute about means and not about ends

socialism is a species of collectivism and that therefore everything which is true of collectivism as such must apply also to socialism.

The dispute between the modern planners and their opponents is, therefore, not a dispute on whether we ought to choose intelligently between the various
possible organizations of society; It is a dispute about what is the best way of so doing.

But the fact that we have to resort to the substitution of direct regulation by authority where the conditions for the proper working of
competition cannot be created does not prove that we should suppress competition where it can be made to function.

the modern movement for planning is a movement against competition as such

United by hostility to competition but nothing else: a sort of syndicalist or “corporative” organization of industry, in which
competition is more or less suppressed but planning is left in the hands of the independent monopolies of the separate industries.

Although competition can bear some admixture of regulation, it cannot be combined with planning to any extent we like without ceasing to operate as an effective guide to production.

Or, to express it differently, planning and competition can be combined only by planning for competition but not by planning against competition.
