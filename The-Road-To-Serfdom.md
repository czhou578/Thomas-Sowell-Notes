however narrowly that may be circumscribed, and the belief that it is desirable that men should develop their own individual gifts and bents. 

The subsequent elaboration of a consistent argument in favor of economic freedom was the outcome of a free growth of economic activity which
had been the undesigned and unforeseen by-product of political freedom.

There is nothing in the basic principles of liberalism to make it a stationary creed; there are no hard-and-fast rules fixed once and for all.

we should make as much use as possible of the spontaneous forces of society, and resort as little as possible to
coercion, is capable of an infinite variety of applications.

Because of the success already achieved, man became increasingly unwilling to tolerate the evils still with him which now
appeared both unbearable and unnecessary.

The French writers who laid the foundations of modern socialism had no doubt that their ideas could be
put into practice only by a strong dictatorial government.

It was to bring “economic freedom,” without which the political freedom already gained was “not worth having.” 

Max Eastman, Lenin’s old friend, who found himself compelled to admit that “instead of being better, Stalinism is worse than fascism

What the promise really amounted to was that the great existing disparities in the range of choice of different people were
to disappear. The demand for the new freedom was thus only another name for the old demand for an equal distribution of wealth.

That democratic socialism, the great utopia of the last few generations, is not only unachievable, but that to strive for it produces something so utterly different that
few of those who now wish it would be prepared to accept the consequences.

In this sense socialism means the abolition of private enterprise, of private ownership of the means of production, and the creation of a
system of “planned economy” in which the entrepreneur working for profit is replaced by a central planning body.

The dispute about socialism has thus become largely a dispute about means and not about ends

socialism is a species of collectivism and that therefore everything which is true of collectivism as such must apply also to socialism.

The dispute between the modern planners and their opponents is, therefore, not a dispute on whether we ought to choose intelligently between the various
possible organizations of society; It is a dispute about what is the best way of so doing.

But the fact that we have to resort to the substitution of direct regulation by authority where the conditions for the proper working of
competition cannot be created does not prove that we should suppress competition where it can be made to function.

the modern movement for planning is a movement against competition as such

United by hostility to competition but nothing else: a sort of syndicalist or “corporative” organization of industry, in which
competition is more or less suppressed but planning is left in the hands of the independent monopolies of the separate industries.

Although competition can bear some admixture of regulation, it cannot be combined with planning to any extent we like without ceasing to operate as an effective guide to production.

Or, to express it differently, planning and competition can be combined only by planning for competition but not by planning against competition.

The myth is deliberately cultivated that we are embarking on the new course not out of free will but because competition is spontaneously eliminated by
technological changes which we neither can reverse nor should wish to prevent.

Of the various arguments employed to demonstrate the inevitability of planning, the one most frequently heard is that technological changes have made
competition impossible in a constantly increasing number of fields and that the only choice left to us is between control of production by private monopolies
and direction by the government. 

consequence of the advance of technology or whether it is simply the result of
the policies pursued in most countries?

the view according to which the greater efficiency of large-scale production is the cause of the disappearance of competition “finds scant support in any evidence that is
now at hand.

in social evolution nothing is inevitable but thinking, makes it so.

What they generally suggest is that the increasing difficulty of obtaining a coherent picture of the complete economic process makes it indispensable that things should be coordinated by
some central agency if social life is not to dissolve in chaos.

It contends not that modern technique destroys competition but that, on the contrary, it will be impossible to make use of many of the new technological possibilities unless protection against competition is
granted

that there is little question that almost every one of the technical ideals of our experts could be realized within a
comparatively short time if to achieve them were made the sole aim of humanity.

We all find it difficult to bear to see things left undone which everybody must admit are both desirable and possible.

we all think that our personal order of values is not merely personal but that in a free discussion
among rational people we would convince the others that ours is the right one.

it unites almost all the singleminded idealists, all the men and women who have devoted their lives to a single task. 

The welfare and the happiness of millions cannot be measured on a single scale of less and more. The welfare of a people, like the happiness of a man, depends
on a great many things that can be provided in an infinite variety of combinations. 

To direct all our activities according to a single plan presupposes that every one of our needs is given its rank in an order of values
which must be complete enough to make it possible to decide among all the different courses which the planner has to choose.

We are not in the habit of thinking
of moral codes as more or less complete. The fact that we are constantly
choosing between different values without a social code prescribing how we
ought to choose does not surprise us and does not suggest to us that our moral
code is incomplete. 

a “social” view
about what ought to be done must guide all decisions. In such a world we should
soon find that our moral code is full of gaps.


From the primitive man, who was bound by an
elaborate ritual in almost every one of his daily activities, who was limited by
innumerable taboos, and who could scarcely conceive of doing things in a way
different from his fellows, morals have more and more tended to become merely
limits circumscribing the sphere within which the individual could behave as he
liked. The adoption of a common ethical code comprehensive enough to
determine a unitary economic plan would mean a complete reversal 

It merely starts from the indisputable fact that the limits of our
powers of imagination make it impossible to include in our scale of values more
than a sector of the needs of the whole society, and that, since, strictly speaking,
scales of value can exist only in individual minds, nothing but partial scales of
values exist

 In fact, people are most likely to agree on common action
where the common end is not an ultimate end to them but a means capable of
serving a great variety of purposes.

 But not only when the
state undertakes direct control in fields where there is no such agreement is it
bound to suppress individual freedom. 

The effect of the people’s agreeing
that there must be central planning, without agreeing on the ends, will be rather
as if a group of people were to commit themselves to take a journey together
without agreeing where they want to go: with the result that they may all have to
make a journey which most of them do not want at all.

Majorities will be found where it is a choice between limited alternatives; but it
is a superstition to believe that there must be a majority view on everything.

A democratic assembly voting and amending a comprehensive
economic plan clause by clause, as it deliberates on an ordinary bill, makes
nonsense. An economic plan, to deserve the name, must have a unitary
conception.

in short, which are the
alternatives between which we must choose, can only be known to those who
know all the facts; and only they, the experts, are in a position to decide which of
the different ends are to be given preference. It is inevitable that they should
impose their scale of preferences on the community for which they plan.

 Hitler did not have to
destroy democracy; he merely took advantage of the decay of democracy and at
the critical moment obtained the support of many to whom, though they detested
Hitler, he yet seemed the only man strong enough to get things done.

Central planners trying to recouncile democracy: The only [sic] way in which a planned society differs from that of the
nineteenth century is that more and more spheres of social life, and ultimately
each and all of them, are subjected to state control. But if a few controls can be
held in check by parliamentary sovereignty, so can many

it is not the source but the limitation of
power which prevents it from being arbitrary

If
democracy resolves on a task which necessarily involves the use of power which
cannot be guided by fixed rules, it must become arbitrary power.

The line suggests that democracy, while valuing collective decision-making, is at risk of becoming tyrannical or unfair if it exercises power without clear, objective guidelines.

When the
government has to decide how many pigs are to be raised or how many busses
are to be run, which coal mines are to operate, or at what prices shoes are to be
sold, these decisions cannot be deduced from formal principles or settled for
long periods in advance. They depend inevitably on the circumstances of the
moment, and, in making such decisions, it will always be necessary to balance
one against the other the interests of various persons and groups. In the end
somebody’s views will have to decide whose interests are more important; and
these views must become part of the law of the land, a new distinction of rank
which the coercive apparatus of government imposes upon the people.

If, on the other
hand, the state were to direct the individual’s actions so as to achieve particular
ends, its action would have to be decided on the basis of the full circumstances
of the moment and would therefore be unpredictable. This reduces freedom

If we want
to create new opportunities open to all, to offer chances of which people can
make what use they like, the precise results cannot be foreseen. 


As soon
as the particular effects are foreseen at the time a law is made, it ceases to be a
mere instrument to be used by the people and becomes instead an instrument
used by the lawgiver upon the people and for his ends. The state ceases to be a
piece of utilitarian machinery intended to help individuals in the fullest
development of their individual personality and becomes a “moral” institution—
where “moral” is not used in contrast to immoral but describes an institution
which imposes on its members its views on all moral questions, whether these
views be moral or highly immoral.


If we want to test the usefulness of
the principle of “fairness” in deciding the kind of issues which arise in economic
planning, we must apply it to some question where the gains and the losses are
seen equally clearly. In such instances it is readily recognized that no general
principle such as fairness can provide an answer. 

To revert to a former example: it
does not matter whether we all drive on the left-or on the right-hand side of the
road so long as we all do the same. The important thing is that the rule enables
us to predict other people’s behavior correctly, and this requires that it should
apply to all cases—even if in a particular instance we feel it to be unjust.

The fact that
someone has full legal authority to act in the way he does gives no answer to the
question whether the law gives him power to act arbitrarily or whether the law
prescribes unequivocally how he has to act.

Yet, apart from the pathological case of the miser, there is no such
thing. The ultimate ends of the activities of reasonable beings are never
economic. Strictly speaking, there is no “economic motive” but only economic
factors conditioning our striving for other ends. 

If all
rewards, instead of being offered in money, were offered in the form of public
distinctions or privileges, positions of power over other men, or better housing or
better food, opportunities for travel or education, this would merely mean that
the recipient would no longer be allowed to choose and that whoever fixed the
reward determined not only its size but also the particular form in which it
should be enjoyed.

Economic values are less important
to us than many things precisely because in economic matters we are free to
decide what to us is more, and what less, important. Or, as we might say, because
in the present society it is we who have to solve the economic problems of our
lives.

The question raised by economic planning is, therefore, not merely whether we
shall be able to satisfy what we regard as our more or less important needs in the
way we prefer. It is whether it shall be we who decide what is more, and what is
less, important for us, or whether this is to be decided by the planner.


Central planning means that the economic problem
is to be solved by the community instead of by the individual; but this involves
that it must also be the community, or rather its representatives, who must decide
the relative importance of the different needs.

If
they want to plan, they must control the entry into the different trades and
occupations, or the terms of remuneration, or both.

But when the authority fixes the
remunerations for a whole category and the selection among the candidates is
made by an objective test, the strength of their desire for the job will count for
very little

That people should wish to be relieved of the bitter choice which hard facts
often impose upon them is not surprising. But few want to be relieved through
having the choice made for them by others. People just wish that the choice
should not be necessary at all. 

We should be seriously deceiving ourselves if for these apprehensions we sought
comfort in the consideration that the adoption of central planning would merely
mean a return, after a brief spell of a free economy, to the ties and regulations
which have governed economic activity through most ages, and that therefore
the infringements of personal liberty need not be greater than they were before
the age of laissez faire. 

But, in consequence, the substitution of central
planning for competition would require central direction of a much greater part
of our lives than was ever attempted before. It could not stop at what we regard
as our economic activities, because we are now for almost every part of our lives
dependent on somebody else’s economic activities.

To believe that the power which is thus conferred on the state is merely
transferred to it from others is erroneous. It is a power which is newly created
and which in a competitive society nobody possesses. 

While people will submit to suffering which may hit anyone, they will not so
easily submit to suffering which is the result of the decision of authority.

No socialist movement which aimed at complete equality has ever
gained substantial support. What socialism promised was not an absolutely
equal, but a more just and more equal, distribution.

But once the claim of the individual worker to the
whole of “his” product is disallowed, and the whole of the return from capital is
to be divided among all workers, the problem of how to divide it raises the same
basic issue.

Surely we have learned that knowledge cannot
create new ethical values, that no amount of learning will lead people to hold the
same views on the moral issues which a conscious ordering of all social relations
raises. It is not rational conviction but the acceptance of a creed which is
required to justify a particular plan.

There is a great deal of truth in the often heard statement
that fascism and National Socialism are a sort of middle-class socialism— only
that in Italy and Germany the supporters of these new movements were
economically hardly a middle class any longer.

It will be well to contrast at the outset the two kinds of security: the limited
one, which can be achieved for all, and which is therefore no privilege but a
legitimate object of desire; and absolute security, which in a free society cannot
be achieved for all and which ought not to be given as a privilege—except in a
few special instances such as that of the judges, where complete independence is
of paramount importance. 

No wonder that in consequence
the value attached to the privilege of security constantly increases, the demand
for it becomes more and more urgent, until in the end no price, not even that of
liberty, appears too high.

What is more important is that if we want to leave
them the choice, if they are to be able to judge what they ought to do, they must
be given some readily intelligible yardstick by which to measure the social
importance of the different occupations.


While so long as he keeps to
the safe path of objectively ascertainable duty he may be surer of his income
than the capitalist entrepreneur, the danger which threatens him in case of real
failure is worse than bankruptcy. He may be economically secure so long as he
satisfies his superiors, but this security is bought at the price of the safety of
freedom and life.

The
reason for this is that with every grant of complete security to one group the
insecurity of the rest necessarily increases. If you guarantee to some a fixed part
of a variable cake, the share left to the rest is bound to fluctuate proportionally
more than the size of the whole. And the essential element of security which the
competitive system offers, the great variety of opportunities, is more and more
reduced.

Every restriction on
the freedom of entry into a trade reduces the security of all those outside it. 

Thus, the more we try to provide full security by interfering with the market
system, the greater the insecurity becomes; and, what is worse, the greater
becomes the contrast between the security of those to whom it is granted as a
privilege and the ever increasing insecurity of the underprivileged. And the more
security becomes a privilege, and the greater the danger to those excluded from
it, the higher will security be prized.

There can be no question that adequate security against severe privation, and
the reduction of the avoidable causes of misdirected effort and consequent
disappointment, will have to be one of the main goals of policy. But if these
endeavors are to be successful and are not to destroy individual freedom,
security must be provided outside the market and competition be left to function
unobstructed. 

The chance of imposing a totalitarian regime
on a whole people depends on the leader’s first collecting round him a group
which is prepared voluntarily to submit to that totalitarian discipline which they
are to impose by force upon the rest.

They still hoped for the miracle of a majority’s
agreeing on a particular plan for the organization of the whole of society; others
had already learned the lesson that in a planned society the question can no
longer be on what do a majority of the people agree but what the largest single
group is whose members agree sufficiently to make unified direction of all
affairs possible; or, if no such group large enough to enforce its views exists,
how it can be created and who will succeed in creating it.


If the “community” or the state are prior to the individual, if they have ends of their own independent of and superior to those of the individuals, only those
individuals who work for the same ends can be regarded as members of the community. 

Collectivism has no room for the wide humanitarianism of liberalism but only for the narrow particularism of the totalitarian.

It is a necessary consequence of this view that a person is respected only as a member of the group, that is, only if and in so far as he works for the
recognized common ends, and that he derives his whole dignity only from this membership and not merely from being a man. 

Indeed, the very concepts of humanity and therefore of any form of internationalism are entirely products of
the individualist view of man.

“an increasing tendency among modern men to imagine themselves ethical because they have delegated their vices to larger and larger groups.”

To act on behalf of a group seems to free people of many of the moral restraints which control their behavior as individuals within the group.

To split or decentralize power is necessarily to reduce the absolute amount of power, and the
competitive system is the only system designed to minimize by decentralization the power exercised by man over man.

Quite the reverse; it will take a much greater interest in the individual’s habits of life than
an individualist community. To be a useful member of a collectivist society requires very definite qualities which must be strengthened 
by constant practice.

They only serve, as it were, to fill any gaps which direct orders or the designation of particular aims
may leave, but they can never justify a conflict with the will of the authority.

Once you admit that the individual is merely a means to serve the ends of the higher entity called society or the nation, 
most of those features of totalitarian regimes which horrify us follow of necessity

The moral consequences of totalitarian propaganda are destructive of all morals because they undermine one of the foundations of all morals: the
sense of and the respect for truth. 

But we must not assume that the planner will approach his task aware of that need or that, even if he were
aware of it, it would be possible to create such a comprehensive code in advance.

He only finds out about the conflicts between different needs as he goes along, and he has to make his decisions as the necessity arises. 
The code of values guiding his decisions does not exist in abstracto before the decisions have to be made; it has to be created with the 
particular decisions.

The probable effect on the people’s loyalty to the system becomes the only criterion for deciding whether a
particular piece of information is to be published or suppressed. Everything which might cause doubt about the wisdom
of the government or create discontent will be kept from the people.

Science for science’s sake, art for art’s sake, are equally abhorrent to the Nazis, our socialist intellectuals, and the communists. 
Every activity must derive its justification from a conscious social purpose. There must be no spontaneous, unguided activity, because 
it might produce results which cannot be foreseen and for which the plan does not provide. 

To “plan” or “organize” the growth of mind, or, for that matter, progress in general, is a contradiction in terms. The idea that the human mind ought “consciously” to
control its own development confuses individual reason, which alone can “consciously control” anything, with the interpersonal process to which its
growth is due. 

Individualism is thus an attitude of humility before this social process and of tolerance to other opinions

Every raid on the gains of monopoly, be it in the interest of particular groups or of the state as a whole,
tends to create new vested interests which will help to bolster up monopoly.

The fatal turning-point in the modern development was when the great movement which fought all
privilege, the labor movement, came under the influence of anti-competition doctrines and became itself entangled in the strife for privilege.

Though it is natural that, as the world around us becomes more complex, our resistance grows against the forces which, without our
understanding them, constantly interfere with individual hopes and plans. it is just in these circumstances that it becomes less possible for anyone fully
to understand these forces.

We cannot learn to master the forces of society in the same manner in which we have learned to
master the forces of nature. 

Morals are of necessity a phenomenon of individual conduct but also that they can exist only in the sphere in which the individual is free
to decide for himself and is called upon voluntarily to sacrifice personal advantage to the observance of a moral rule.

If we are to succeed in the war of ideologies and to win over the decent
elements in the enemy countries, we must, first of all, regain the belief in the
traditional values for which we have stood in the past and must have the moral courage stoutly to defend the ideals which our enemies attack. 

Not by shamefaced apologies and by assurances that we are rapidly reforming, not by explaining that we are seeking some compromise between the traditional liberal
values and the new totalitarian ideas, shall we win confidence and support.

Many kinds of economic planning are indeed practicable only if the planning authority can effectively shut out all extraneous influences; the
result of such planning is therefore inevitably the piling-up of restrictions on the movements of men and goods.

Fatal illusion that, by substituting negotiations between states or organized groups for competition for markets or for raw materials, international
friction would be reduced.

If it comes to be regarded as the duty of the international authority to bring about distributive justice between the different peoples, 
it is no more than a consistent and inevitable development of socialist doctrine that class strife would
become a struggle between the working classes of the different countries.

Where the assumption of a moral responsibility involves that one’s moral views should by force be made to
prevail over those dominant in other communities, it becomes impossible to act morally. 

Nowhere has democracy ever worked well without a great measure of local self-government, providing a school of political training
for the people and future leaders. 

The awareness of one’s neighbor rather than some theoretical knowledge of the needs of other people which guides action, that the ordinary
man can take a real part in public affairs because they concern the world he knows.

We must not believe that we can at one stroke create a permanent organization which will make all war in any part of the world entirely
impossible. Not only would we be unsuccessful in such an attempt but we would probably spoil our chances of achieving success.
