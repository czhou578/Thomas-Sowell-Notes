however narrowly that may be circumscribed, and the belief that it is desirable that men should develop their own individual gifts and bents. 

The subsequent elaboration of a consistent argument in favor of economic freedom was the outcome of a free growth of economic activity which
had been the undesigned and unforeseen by-product of political freedom.

There is nothing in the basic principles of liberalism to make it a stationary creed; there are no hard-and-fast rules fixed once and for all.

we should make as much use as possible of the spontaneous forces of society, and resort as little as possible to
coercion, is capable of an infinite variety of applications.

Because of the success already achieved, man became increasingly unwilling to tolerate the evils still with him which now
appeared both unbearable and unnecessary.

The French writers who laid the foundations of modern socialism had no doubt that their ideas could be
put into practice only by a strong dictatorial government.

It was to bring “economic freedom,” without which the political freedom already gained was “not worth having.” 

Max Eastman, Lenin’s old friend, who found himself compelled to admit that “instead of being better, Stalinism is worse than fascism

What the promise really amounted to was that the great existing disparities in the range of choice of different people were
to disappear. The demand for the new freedom was thus only another name for the old demand for an equal distribution of wealth.

That democratic socialism, the great utopia of the last few generations, is not only unachievable, but that to strive for it produces something so utterly different that
few of those who now wish it would be prepared to accept the consequences.

In this sense socialism means the abolition of private enterprise, of private ownership of the means of production, and the creation of a
system of “planned economy” in which the entrepreneur working for profit is replaced by a central planning body.

The dispute about socialism has thus become largely a dispute about means and not about ends

socialism is a species of collectivism and that therefore everything which is true of collectivism as such must apply also to socialism.

The dispute between the modern planners and their opponents is, therefore, not a dispute on whether we ought to choose intelligently between the various
possible organizations of society; It is a dispute about what is the best way of so doing.

But the fact that we have to resort to the substitution of direct regulation by authority where the conditions for the proper working of
competition cannot be created does not prove that we should suppress competition where it can be made to function.

the modern movement for planning is a movement against competition as such

United by hostility to competition but nothing else: a sort of syndicalist or “corporative” organization of industry, in which
competition is more or less suppressed but planning is left in the hands of the independent monopolies of the separate industries.

Although competition can bear some admixture of regulation, it cannot be combined with planning to any extent we like without ceasing to operate as an effective guide to production.

Or, to express it differently, planning and competition can be combined only by planning for competition but not by planning against competition.

The myth is deliberately cultivated that we are embarking on the new course not out of free will but because competition is spontaneously eliminated by
technological changes which we neither can reverse nor should wish to prevent.

Of the various arguments employed to demonstrate the inevitability of planning, the one most frequently heard is that technological changes have made
competition impossible in a constantly increasing number of fields and that the only choice left to us is between control of production by private monopolies
and direction by the government. 

consequence of the advance of technology or whether it is simply the result of
the policies pursued in most countries?

the view according to which the greater efficiency of large-scale production is the cause of the disappearance of competition “finds scant support in any evidence that is
now at hand.

in social evolution nothing is inevitable but thinking, makes it so.

What they generally suggest is that the increasing difficulty of obtaining a coherent picture of the complete economic process makes it indispensable that things should be coordinated by
some central agency if social life is not to dissolve in chaos.

It contends not that modern technique destroys competition but that, on the contrary, it will be impossible to make use of many of the new technological possibilities unless protection against competition is
granted

that there is little question that almost every one of the technical ideals of our experts could be realized within a
comparatively short time if to achieve them were made the sole aim of humanity.

We all find it difficult to bear to see things left undone which everybody must admit are both desirable and possible.

we all think that our personal order of values is not merely personal but that in a free discussion
among rational people we would convince the others that ours is the right one.

it unites almost all the singleminded idealists, all the men and women who have devoted their lives to a single task. 

The welfare and the happiness of millions cannot be measured on a single scale of less and more. The welfare of a people, like the happiness of a man, depends
on a great many things that can be provided in an infinite variety of combinations. 

To direct all our activities according to a single plan presupposes that every one of our needs is given its rank in an order of values
which must be complete enough to make it possible to decide among all the different courses which the planner has to choose.

We are not in the habit of thinking
of moral codes as more or less complete. The fact that we are constantly
choosing between different values without a social code prescribing how we
ought to choose does not surprise us and does not suggest to us that our moral
code is incomplete. 

a “social” view
about what ought to be done must guide all decisions. In such a world we should
soon find that our moral code is full of gaps.


From the primitive man, who was bound by an
elaborate ritual in almost every one of his daily activities, who was limited by
innumerable taboos, and who could scarcely conceive of doing things in a way
different from his fellows, morals have more and more tended to become merely
limits circumscribing the sphere within which the individual could behave as he
liked. The adoption of a common ethical code comprehensive enough to
determine a unitary economic plan would mean a complete reversal 

It merely starts from the indisputable fact that the limits of our
powers of imagination make it impossible to include in our scale of values more
than a sector of the needs of the whole society, and that, since, strictly speaking,
scales of value can exist only in individual minds, nothing but partial scales of
values exist

 In fact, people are most likely to agree on common action
where the common end is not an ultimate end to them but a means capable of
serving a great variety of purposes.

 But not only when the
state undertakes direct control in fields where there is no such agreement is it
bound to suppress individual freedom. 

The effect of the people’s agreeing
that there must be central planning, without agreeing on the ends, will be rather
as if a group of people were to commit themselves to take a journey together
without agreeing where they want to go: with the result that they may all have to
make a journey which most of them do not want at all.

Majorities will be found where it is a choice between limited alternatives; but it
is a superstition to believe that there must be a majority view on everything.

A democratic assembly voting and amending a comprehensive
economic plan clause by clause, as it deliberates on an ordinary bill, makes
nonsense. An economic plan, to deserve the name, must have a unitary
conception.

in short, which are the
alternatives between which we must choose, can only be known to those who
know all the facts; and only they, the experts, are in a position to decide which of
the different ends are to be given preference. It is inevitable that they should
impose their scale of preferences on the community for which they plan.

 Hitler did not have to
destroy democracy; he merely took advantage of the decay of democracy and at
the critical moment obtained the support of many to whom, though they detested
Hitler, he yet seemed the only man strong enough to get things done.

Central planners trying to recouncile democracy: The only [sic] way in which a planned society differs from that of the
nineteenth century is that more and more spheres of social life, and ultimately
each and all of them, are subjected to state control. But if a few controls can be
held in check by parliamentary sovereignty, so can many

it is not the source but the limitation of
power which prevents it from being arbitrary

If
democracy resolves on a task which necessarily involves the use of power which
cannot be guided by fixed rules, it must become arbitrary power.

The line suggests that democracy, while valuing collective decision-making, is at risk of becoming tyrannical or unfair if it exercises power without clear, objective guidelines.

When the
government has to decide how many pigs are to be raised or how many busses
are to be run, which coal mines are to operate, or at what prices shoes are to be
sold, these decisions cannot be deduced from formal principles or settled for
long periods in advance. They depend inevitably on the circumstances of the
moment, and, in making such decisions, it will always be necessary to balance
one against the other the interests of various persons and groups. In the end
somebody’s views will have to decide whose interests are more important; and
these views must become part of the law of the land, a new distinction of rank
which the coercive apparatus of government imposes upon the people.

If, on the other
hand, the state were to direct the individual’s actions so as to achieve particular
ends, its action would have to be decided on the basis of the full circumstances
of the moment and would therefore be unpredictable. This reduces freedom

If we want
to create new opportunities open to all, to offer chances of which people can
make what use they like, the precise results cannot be foreseen. 


As soon
as the particular effects are foreseen at the time a law is made, it ceases to be a
mere instrument to be used by the people and becomes instead an instrument
used by the lawgiver upon the people and for his ends. The state ceases to be a
piece of utilitarian machinery intended to help individuals in the fullest
development of their individual personality and becomes a “moral” institution—
where “moral” is not used in contrast to immoral but describes an institution
which imposes on its members its views on all moral questions, whether these
views be moral or highly immoral.


If we want to test the usefulness of
the principle of “fairness” in deciding the kind of issues which arise in economic
planning, we must apply it to some question where the gains and the losses are
seen equally clearly. In such instances it is readily recognized that no general
principle such as fairness can provide an answer. 

To revert to a former example: it
does not matter whether we all drive on the left-or on the right-hand side of the
road so long as we all do the same. The important thing is that the rule enables
us to predict other people’s behavior correctly, and this requires that it should
apply to all cases—even if in a particular instance we feel it to be unjust.
